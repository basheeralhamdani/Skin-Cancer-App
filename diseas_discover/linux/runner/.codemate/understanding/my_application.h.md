High-Level Documentation

Overview  
This header file declares the interface for MyApplication, a custom GTK-based application class intended for use with Flutter on Linux. MyApplication serves as the main entry point for a Flutter application running within a GTK environment.

Key Components

- Inheritance: MyApplication is a final type derived from GtkApplication, using the GObject type system provided by GLib.
- Type Declaration: G_DECLARE_FINAL_TYPE macro is used to declare the type and its associated boilerplate for GObject.
- Constructor Function:
  - my_application_new(): Function to create a new instance of MyApplication.
  - Returns a pointer to the newly created MyApplication object.
  
Usage  
- Include this header to gain access to the MyApplication type.
- Use my_application_new() to instantiate the main application object.
- Typical use in a main() function: create the MyApplication instance and run the GTK main loop.

Intended Purpose  
This component encapsulates the application lifecycle and initialization logic for a Flutter application on Linux, leveraging GTK for system integration.

Notes  
- Designed for internal or application-level use in projects integrating Flutter with GTK on Linux.
- Implementation details (e.g., signal handlers, initialization routines) are not present in this header.
