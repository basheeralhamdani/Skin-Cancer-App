# Code Review Report

**Project:** runner  
**File:** CMakeLists.txt  
**Review Focus:** Adherence to industry standards, optimization, error checking, idiomatic CMake usage.

## Observations & Issues

### 1. **Usage of `add_definitions()` for Preprocessor Definitions**
- **Problem:** `add_definitions(-D...)` is an older command from CMake. In modern CMake, it is recommended to use `target_compile_definitions()` for target-specific preprocessor definitions. `add_definitions()` applies globally and is less clear and maintainable.
- **Correction (suggested pseudo code):**
    ```cmake
    target_compile_definitions(${BINARY_NAME} PRIVATE APPLICATION_ID="${APPLICATION_ID}")
    ```
- **Action:** Replace or supplement `add_definitions()` with `target_compile_definitions()` for clarity and modern CMake compliance.

---

### 2. **Potential Undeclared or Unset Variables**
- **Problem:** 
    - `BINARY_NAME`, `APPLICATION_ID`, and `FLUTTER_MANAGED_DIR` must be defined before use. Their definitions are missing in this snippet and should be confirmed. Otherwise, the build will fail.
- **Correction (suggested pseudo code):**
    ```cmake
    # Ensure definitions, replace with appropriate defaults or error out if unset
    if(NOT DEFINED BINARY_NAME)
      message(FATAL_ERROR "BINARY_NAME is not set")
    endif()
    if(NOT DEFINED APPLICATION_ID)
      message(FATAL_ERROR "APPLICATION_ID is not set")
    endif()
    if(NOT DEFINED FLUTTER_MANAGED_DIR)
      message(FATAL_ERROR "FLUTTER_MANAGED_DIR is not set")
    endif()
    ```
- **Action:** Add checks for required variables or provide sensible defaults.

---

### 3. **Order of `target_link_libraries` Calls**
- **Problem:** Multiple separate `target_link_libraries()` calls can be combined for clarity:
- **Correction (suggested pseudo code):**
    ```cmake
    target_link_libraries(${BINARY_NAME} PRIVATE flutter PkgConfig::GTK)
    ```
- **Action:** Combine all external library links into a single call for improved readability.

---

### 4. **Use of `apply_standard_settings()`**
- **Note:** If `apply_standard_settings()` is a custom function, there should be a check for its existence, or a note in documentation on where itâ€™s defined to avoid confusion for future maintainers.
- **Correction (suggested pseudo code):**
    ```cmake
    if(NOT COMMAND apply_standard_settings)
      message(WARNING "apply_standard_settings() not defined, skipping.")
    else()
      apply_standard_settings(${BINARY_NAME})
    endif()
    ```
- **Action:** Ensure this function is sourced, or inform maintainers/document its origin.

---

### 5. **Include Directories**
- **Problem:** Use of `${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}` as an include directory is broad and may unintentionally expose more headers than desired.
- **Correction (suggested pseudo code):**
    ```cmake
    # Only include specific directories if possible
    target_include_directories(${BINARY_NAME} PRIVATE "${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/include")
    ```
- **Action:** Limit include directories to where headers are actually stored.

| Issue                          | Correction (Pseudo Code)                                                                  |
|---------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| Preprocessor definitions        | `target_compile_definitions(${BINARY_NAME} PRIVATE APPLICATION_ID="${APPLICATION_ID}")`   |
| Undeclared variable checks      | `if(NOT DEFINED VAR) message(FATAL_ERROR "VAR is not set") endif()`                       |
| Library linking                 | `target_link_libraries(${BINARY_NAME} PRIVATE flutter PkgConfig::GTK)`                    |
| Custom function existence       | `if(NOT COMMAND apply_standard_settings) ... endif()`                                     |
| Include directories             | `target_include_directories(${BINARY_NAME} PRIVATE "${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/include")`        |

## Recommendations

- Switch to modern CMake idioms.
- Ensure all variables used are defined before use.
- Refine include directory exposure.
- Combine and organize related statements for maintainability and clarity.
- Document any custom or project-specific functions/macros.
