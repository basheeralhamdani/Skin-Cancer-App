# Code Review Report

**Reviewed Section:**  
`flutter/ephemeral`

---

## 1. General Concerns

- Storing editable or user-maintained code in an `ephemeral` directory is discouraged. Any content in this folder will be overwritten by Flutter tooling.
- The `ephemeral` directory is generated at build time and should **not** contain business logic, hand-written assets, configuration templates, or any source files intended for version control or manual editing.

---

## 2. Industry Standards & Best Practices

### 2.1. Version Control

**Issue:**  
- Including `flutter/ephemeral` in version control (e.g., Git) leads to unnecessary bloat and potential merge conflicts.

**Recommendation:**  
- Add the following to your `.gitignore`:

    ```plaintext
    # Suggested addition to .gitignore
    flutter/ephemeral/
    ```

---

### 2.2. Project Structure

**Issue:**  
- Placing custom code/assets in `flutter/ephemeral` is non-standard. This directory is meant only for Flutter tooling outputs.

**Recommendation:**  
- Move all non-generated code and configuration files to appropriate directories (`lib/`, `assets/`, etc.).

    ```plaintext
    # Pseudocode for suggested project structure
    - lib/
      - your_source_files.dart
    - assets/
      - images/
      - fonts/
    - flutter/
      - ephemeral/  # Should only contain auto-generated files
    ```

---

### 2.3. Build Optimization

**Issue:**  
- Custom or unoptimized implementations placed in `ephemeral` will be lost on `flutter clean` or during a re-build.

**Recommendation:**  
- Remove any custom code from `ephemeral` and refactor it into persistent source directories.

    ```plaintext
    # Pseudocode for refactoring misplaced code
    move('flutter/ephemeral/my_custom_file.dart', 'lib/my_custom_file.dart')
    ```

---

### 2.4. Error Handling

**Issue:**  
- Modifying ephemeral files can break the build process or cause inconsistent states.

**Recommendation:**  
- Add documentation or code comments warning against modifying or using files from `ephemeral`.

    ```plaintext
    # Add to relevant documentation:
    "Warning: Do not edit files in flutter/ephemeral/. These are auto-generated and subject to removal at any time."
    ```

## 3. Summary Table

| Issue                                                                | Severity  | Recommendation                                                                             |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------- |---------- |------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Storing code in ephemeral directory                                  | ★★★★☆     | Move code/assets to appropriate project directories                                        |
| Not ignoring ephemeral in version control                            | ★★★★☆     | Add `flutter/ephemeral/` to `.gitignore`                                                   |
| Potential accidental editing of generated files                      | ★★★☆☆     | Add code comments/documentation on not modifying ephemeral files                           |
| Risk of losing changes due to regeneration                           | ★★★★☆     | Never place critical or hand-written code under `ephemeral`                                |

## 4. Corrected Pseudocode Suggestions

```plaintext
# .gitignore additions
flutter/ephemeral/

# Pseudocode to move custom files (if any)
move('flutter/ephemeral/custom_code.dart', 'lib/custom_code.dart')
```

**Final Note:**  
No actual application or source code logic should ever reside in `flutter/ephemeral/`. Ensure your build and repository practices reflect this to prevent future team/CI/CD issues.  
If you intended to submit a specific file from within `ephemeral`, please provide the contents for a deeper technical review.
