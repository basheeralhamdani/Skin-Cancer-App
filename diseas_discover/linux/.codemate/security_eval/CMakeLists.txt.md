# Security Vulnerabilities Report

This report analyzes the provided `CMakeLists.txt` code for **security vulnerabilities only**. Recommendations and descriptions focus strictly on security implications in the build configuration.

---

## 1. RPATH Manipulation (`set(CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH "$ORIGIN/lib")`)

### Finding
```cmake
set(CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH "$ORIGIN/lib")
```

**Description:**  
Setting the RPATH to `$ORIGIN/lib` allows the built binaries to search for dynamic libraries in a path relative to the binary's location. This increases the risk that malicious or unintended libraries could be loaded if an attacker is able to place files in these directories.

**Risk:**  
- **Library Hijacking:** Attackers with write access to the binary directory could add malicious shared libraries, which would be loaded by the application due to the RPATH setting.
- Particularly dangerous if binaries are installed to world-writable locations or if runtime directories are not sufficiently protected.

**Recommendation:**  
- Ensure installation directories and `lib/` directories are not writable by unprivileged users.
- Consider using `RUNPATH` or other mechanisms to restrict/prefer system library paths.
- If possible, do not use relative RPATHs or restrict write permissions to installation locations.

## 2. Potential for Overwriting Critical Files (`file(REMOVE_RECURSE ...)` in `install(CODE "...")`)

### Finding
```cmake
install(CODE "
  file(REMOVE_RECURSE \"${BUILD_BUNDLE_DIR}/\")
  " COMPONENT Runtime)
```
and
```cmake
install(CODE "
  file(REMOVE_RECURSE \"${INSTALL_BUNDLE_DATA_DIR}/${FLUTTER_ASSET_DIR_NAME}\")
  " COMPONENT Runtime)
```

**Description:**  
The use of `file(REMOVE_RECURSE ...)` can delete entire directories, depending on the outcome of variable evaluation. If variable values are misconfigured (either accidentally or maliciously), this could recursively delete unintended files or directories at install time.

**Risk:**  
- **Destructive Deletes:** Malformed or injected values into variables like `BUILD_BUNDLE_DIR` or `INSTALL_BUNDLE_DATA_DIR` could lead to the deletion of data outside the intended build/install directory (e.g., `/`, `/home`, `/usr`).
- **Privilege Escalation:** If installs are performed as root, this increases the risk.

**Recommendation:**  
- Sanitize and validate these variables to ensure they never point outside the project/build directory.
- Add CMake assertions or protections (e.g., check path prefixes, ensure non-rooted paths).
- Consider logging or warning before recursive deletions.

## 3. Native Asset Unverified Copy (`install(DIRECTORY ...)`)

### Finding
```cmake
install(DIRECTORY "${NATIVE_ASSETS_DIR}"
   DESTINATION "${INSTALL_BUNDLE_LIB_DIR}"
   COMPONENT Runtime)
```

**Description:**  
Native asset directories are copied into the final deployment directory without validation. If third-party packages can contribute files, or if the build directory can be modified by unprivileged users, this could be used to inject malicious code (e.g., shared libraries, scripts, resources) into the package.

**Risk:**  
- **Malicious Files in Bundle:** Unsanitized files could be included in the bundle, increasing the risk of unexpected or malicious behavior at runtime.

**Recommendation:**  
- Limit write access to `${NATIVE_ASSETS_DIR}` to authorized build processes only.
- Optionally verify or audit contents before copying.
- Use checksum or signing mechanisms for critical files/binaries.

## 4. Lack of Binary Hardening Compiler Flags

### Finding
```cmake
target_compile_options(${TARGET} PRIVATE -Wall -Werror)
target_compile_options(${TARGET} PRIVATE "$<$<NOT:$<CONFIG:Debug>>:-O3>")
```

**Description:**  
No explicit hardening flags are set (e.g., `-fstack-protector`, `-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2`, `-Wl,-z,relro,-z,now`). These flags mitigate common vulnerabilities like buffer overflows.

**Risk:**  
- **Exploitable Binaries:** Absence of hardening increases the risk of successful exploitation of memory corruption vulnerabilities.

**Recommendation:**  
- Add hardening flags to `target_compile_options()` and/or `target_link_options()`:
  - GCC/Clang: `-fstack-protector-strong`, `-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2`, `-D_GLIBCXX_ASSERTIONS`
  - Linker: `-Wl,-z,relro,-z,now`, `-Wl,-z,noexecstack`
- Set these for all non-Debug builds.

## 5. Insufficient Control of Destination Directory Permissions

### Finding
Installations are performed with:
```cmake
install(TARGETS ${BINARY_NAME} RUNTIME DESTINATION "${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}"
  COMPONENT Runtime)
...
install(DIRECTORY "${NATIVE_ASSETS_DIR}" DESTINATION "${INSTALL_BUNDLE_LIB_DIR}" COMPONENT Runtime)
```
**Description:**  
Permissions for installed files and directories are not explicitly set. This can result in files being world-writable or accessible by unintended users, depending on system `umask` or CMake defaults.

**Risk:**  
- **Privilege Escalation/File Tampering:** Insecure permissions may allow non-privileged users to replace or edit critical binaries/libraries.

**Recommendation:**  
- Explicitly set file and directory permissions during install using the `PERMISSIONS` argument to `install()` if using CMake 3.14+.
- Ensure that installation directories are not shared with untrusted users.

---

## 6. No Verification of External Dependencies

### Finding
```cmake
pkg_check_modules(GTK REQUIRED IMPORTED_TARGET gtk+-3.0)
```
**Description:**  
GTK and other libraries are used from system locations without verification of integrity or version, relying on system package managers.

**Risk:**  
- **Library Poisoning:** If an attacker controls the system package space, they could introduce malicious libraries.

**Recommendation:**  
- Restrict build and install operations to trusted systems.
- For higher security, consider using cryptographically verified dependencies (signed packages, hashes).

# General Best Practices

- **Least privilege principle:** Restrict all directories and operations to authorized users only.
- **Validation:** Sanitize all file paths and variable usage that involve deletion, installation, or copying of assets.
- **Binary/Library Verification:** Employ signatures and hash checks where possible, especially when including third-party code.
