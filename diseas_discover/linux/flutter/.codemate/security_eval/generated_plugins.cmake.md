# Security Vulnerability Report

This report analyzes the provided CMake script for **security vulnerabilities**, focusing solely on aspects that may lead to security risks in the context of building and linking Flutter plugins for a Linux application.

---

## 1. Insecure Plugin Path Inclusion

### Code Segment

```cmake
foreach(plugin ${FLUTTER_PLUGIN_LIST})
  add_subdirectory(flutter/ephemeral/.plugin_symlinks/${plugin}/linux plugins/${plugin})
  ...
endforeach(plugin)

foreach(ffi_plugin ${FLUTTER_FFI_PLUGIN_LIST})
  add_subdirectory(flutter/ephemeral/.plugin_symlinks/${ffi_plugin}/linux plugins/${ffi_plugin})
  ...
endforeach(ffi_plugin)
```

### Vulnerability

- **Unvalidated Path Expansion**: The use of `${plugin}` and `${ffi_plugin}` to construct paths (e.g., `flutter/ephemeral/.plugin_symlinks/${plugin}/linux`) without sanitization exposes the build system to **path traversal** and **code injection** vulnerabilities if malicious or unexpected values are allowed into these variables.
- **Symlink Attacks**: The build relies on symlinks in `.plugin_symlinks`; if an attacker can control these links (through, for example, an untrusted plugin being injected into the plugin list), they can redirect the build process to arbitrary files or code.
- **Potential DLL Preloading**: If plugins are built from untrusted sources or fetched from compromised sources, there is a risk of loading malicious libraries, resulting in execution of arbitrary code during the build or at runtime.

#### Exploit Scenario

- If `${plugin}` is manipulated to contain `../../malicious_dir`, the build system could add and link code from unintended locations.

## 2. Unrestricted Linking of Plugin Libraries

### Code Segment

```cmake
target_link_libraries(${BINARY_NAME} PRIVATE ${plugin}_plugin)
list(APPEND PLUGIN_BUNDLED_LIBRARIES $<TARGET_FILE:${plugin}_plugin>)
list(APPEND PLUGIN_BUNDLED_LIBRARIES ${${plugin}_bundled_libraries})
```

### Vulnerability

- **Implicit Trust in Plugin Binaries**: The script automatically links binaries with `${plugin}_plugin` and includes whatever libraries are listed in `${plugin}_bundled_libraries`. This could include **malicious or trojaned binaries** if plugins are not trusted or verified.
- **Lack of Integrity/Signature Checking**: There are no checks to validate the authenticity and integrity of plugin code before linking, enabling attackers to supply tampered plugin binaries.

#### Exploit Scenario

- An attacker introduces a plugin or modifies an existing plugin to include malware. The script unconditionally links to this binary, and the resulting application may execute malicious code.

---

## 3. Absence of Input Validation

### General Vulnerability

- **Direct Variable Expansion**: All user or system input (e.g., plugin names, plugin library lists) is expanded and used in critical commands (like `add_subdirectory`, `target_link_libraries`) without any validation or sanitization.

#### Exploit Scenario

- If the input variables are manipulated (through environment injection, configuration tampering, or build system compromise), arbitrary code can be added to the build process.

---

## 4. No Restrictions on External Plugin Sources

### General Vulnerability

- **Unconstrained Plugin Source Inclusion**: The script does not enforce any restriction (e.g., known-safe source lists, code signing, directory whitelisting) on where plugins are sourced from or what they can contain.
- Anyone with the ability to inject directories, symlinks, or files into the `flutter/ephemeral/.plugin_symlinks` directory or to modify the `FLUTTER_PLUGIN_LIST` can potentially compromise the build.

---

## Recommendations

- **Validate and Sanitize Input:** Always sanitize `${plugin}` and `${ffi_plugin}` to avoid path traversal and code injection.
- **Restrict Plugin Directories:** Only allow plugins from trusted, whitelisted paths.
- **Check Plugin Integrity:** Implement plugin signature verification or integrity checking before build/link.
- **Harden File Permissions:** Lock down who can write to `.plugin_symlinks` and related directories.
- **Log and Monitor:** Monitor plugin directory changes and alert on unauthorized modifications.

# Summary Table

| Vulnerability               | Location(s)                               | Impact                             |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Path Traversal & Symlink    | add_subdirectory with unsanitized vars    | Build system code execution         |
| DLL Preloading / Arbitrary Linking | target_link_libraries without verification | Application code compromise         |
| Lack of Input Validation    | All variable expansions                   | Remote/local attack vector exploit  |
| Plugin Source Unrestricted  | Plugin directory management               | Persistent compromise, supply chain |

---

**Conclusion:**  
The script, as provided, contains multiple opportunities for security compromise due to lack of validation and trust boundaries in plugin management. All plugin sources, paths, and files should be strongly validated, and plugin binaries must be verified before inclusion. 

**Mitigation is strongly recommended before using in a production environment.**
