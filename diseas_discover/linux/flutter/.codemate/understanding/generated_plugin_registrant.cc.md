# High-Level Documentation

## Purpose

This file is a **generated C++ source file** used in a Flutter application targeting Linux. Its primary function is to register native plugins with the Flutter engine at startup, enabling their integration and use in the Dart side of the app.

## Overview

- **Do Not Edit:** This file is auto-generated, and any changes will be overwritten next time code generation occurs.
- **Plugin Registration:** The code includes the necessary headers and contains a function to register specific Linux plugins with the Flutter plugin registry.

## Key Components

1. **Plugin Includes**
   - `<file_selector_linux/file_selector_plugin.h>`: For file selection dialogs.
   - `<url_launcher_linux/url_launcher_plugin.h>`: For launching URLs on Linux.

2. **Registration Function**
   ```cpp
   void fl_register_plugins(FlPluginRegistry* registry);
   ```
   - This function is called during Flutter app startup.
   - It registers each included plugin (`FileSelectorPlugin` and `UrlLauncherPlugin`) with the provided Flutter plugin registry.

3. **How Registration Works**
   - Retrieves a registrar object for each plugin using the plugin's name.
   - Calls the plugin-specific registration function with the registrar to complete the setup.

## Summary

This file ensures that the listed C++ plugins are properly registered and available to the Flutter (Dart) layer when running on Linux. Do not manually edit this file; instead, manage plugins through Flutter's configuration tools (e.g., pubspec.yaml).
