# High-Level Documentation

## Overview

This code is a **CMake build configuration file** auto-generated for a Flutter project targeting Linux. It integrates and manages native (C/C++) plugins in the project. The file organizes how plugins are added to the CMake build, ensuring they are properly included, linked, and their libraries are bundled with the build output.

**Do not edit this file manually; it will be overwritten by Flutter tooling.**

---

## Main Components

### 1. Plugin Lists

- **FLUTTER_PLUGIN_LIST:**  
  A list of standard Flutter plugins to be included in the build (e.g., `file_selector_linux`, `url_launcher_linux`).

- **FLUTTER_FFI_PLUGIN_LIST:**  
  A list of Flutter plugins that use FFI (Foreign Function Interface). This is empty in the provided code.

---

### 2. Plugin Inclusion and Linking

#### For Each Plugin in FLUTTER_PLUGIN_LIST:

- **Add Plugin Subdirectory:**  
  Includes the CMake subdirectory for the plugin's Linux implementation (via a symlink).

- **Link Plugin to Binary:**  
  Links the plugin's shared library to the main binary target (`${BINARY_NAME}`).

- **Bundle Plugin Libraries:**  
  Adds the plugin's compiled library, and any additional libraries it specifies, to the list of bundled libraries for packaging or distribution.

#### For Each Plugin in FLUTTER_FFI_PLUGIN_LIST:

- **Add Plugin Subdirectory:**  
  As above, but specifically for FFI-based plugins.

- **Bundle Plugin Libraries:**  
  Adds FFI plugin bundled libraries to the overall set (no linking, as FFI uses runtime dynamic loading).

---

### 3. Bundled Libraries

- **PLUGIN_BUNDLED_LIBRARIES:**  
  A variable that collects all the libraries that need to be included in the final distribution package.

---

## Summary

- **Purpose:** Automates incorporation of Flutter plugins into Linux builds.
- **Maintains:** Proper inclusion, linking, and bundling of both standard and FFI-based plugins.
- **Modifies:** Should only be managed via Flutter's tools, not hand-edited.

**In essence:**  
This CMake file simplifies the process of adding and integrating plugins in a Flutter Linux desktop application by programmatically updating build steps whenever plugins are added, removed, or changed.
