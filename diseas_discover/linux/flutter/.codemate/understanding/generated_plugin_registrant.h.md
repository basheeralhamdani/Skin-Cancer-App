High-Level Documentation

Overview:
This code defines a generated C/C++ header file for registering plugins with a Flutter application targeting Linux. It provides an interface for integrating Flutter plugins into a Linux project, enabling the runtime to discover and use additional functionality via dynamically loaded plugins.

Key Components:

Header Guards:
Prevents multiple inclusions of this header file using #ifndef, #define, and #endif.

Includes:
#include <flutter_linux/flutter_linux.h> 
Imports the necessary Flutter Linux API definitions for plugin registration.

Function Declaration:
void fl_register_plugins(FlPluginRegistry* registry);
Declares a function intended to register all the plugins that have been linked with this Flutter application. The function expects a pointer to a FlPluginRegistry, which acts as the plugin manager for the Flutter engine.

Generated File Notice:
Includes comments indicating that the file is automatically generated and should not be manually edited. This implies that plugins are managed and registered via Flutter tooling.

Usage:
This header is included in the Linux-side entry point of a Flutter app. The engine or main application calls fl_register_plugins during startup, ensuring all generated and linked plugins are initialized and available to the running Flutter instance.

Summary:
The file acts as a central registry interface for plugins on Flutter Linux applications, facilitating automatic and maintainable plugin integration without manual intervention in plugin registration code.
