## Identified Security Vulnerabilities

### 1. **Exposure of Sensitive API Key**
- **Issue:**  
  The Firebase (Google Cloud) API key `AIzaSyBqep8M1PujFLwo9y0BPC7pQ1gYce4u-jo` is present in the code/configuration file. Publishing or exposing this key publicly (e.g., in a public repository or client code) can lead to abuse.
- **Impact:**  
  Attackers can use this key to access the associated Firebase project, potentially:
    - Reading or writing to Firestore/Realtime Database if rules are insecure  
    - Using authentication methods
    - Consuming cloud resources (increased costs, potential DoS)
- **Recommendation:**  
  - **Never commit/store sensitive keys in public code or repositories.**
  - **Regenerate and rotate the exposed API key.**
  - **Configure Firebase security rules strictly.**
  - **Restrict API usage in Google Cloud Console by IP, HTTP referrer, or app package.**

### 2. **Potential Weak Configuration for Authentication**
- **Issue:**  
  The `oauth_client` array is empty. While not a direct vulnerability, this means there are no OAuth client IDs configured, possibly forcing reliance on only API keys.
- **Impact:**  
  Insufficient or absent OAuth configuration can make APIs accessible via only the exposed API key, which (if rules are lax) could allow unauthorized access.
- **Recommendation:**  
  - Ensure proper OAuth clients are configured if needed.
  - Avoid relying exclusively on API keys for authorization.

### 3. **Disclosure of Project Structure and IDs**
- **Issue:**  
  Project number, project ID, and bucket names are disclosed.
- **Impact:**  
  - Increases the attack surface for social engineering, phishing, or targeted attacks.
  - May aid attackers in crafting more effective exploits.
- **Recommendation:**  
  - Avoid sharing internal project identifiers publicly.
  - Treat this metadata as sensitive and obfuscate/redact in public forums.

## Mitigation Steps ‚≠ê

- **Regenerate/rotate the exposed API key.**
- **Do not expose API keys and project details publicly.**
- **Update Firebase/Google Cloud security rules to minimize damage if a key is leaked.**
- **Restrict API keys provisioned for client-side use (limit endpoints, usage, referrers).**
- **Audit current app permissions and disable any unused services.**
- **Educate developers on secure credential management.**
