# Security Vulnerability Report

## Target File

**Type:** Gradle Build File (build.gradle)
**Context:** Android application (Flutter/dart/kotlin)

---

## Security Vulnerabilities Identified

### 1. **Hardcoded Application ID and Potential Exposure**
- **Observation:**  
  ```groovy
  applicationId = "com.example.diseas_discover"
  ```
- **Risk:**  
  Using generic package/application IDs such as `"com.example.*"` may expose the app to namespace squatting or impersonation in distribution platforms. In addition, if this ID is not adequately protected and allowed in production, malicious actors may hijack the namespace.
- **Suggested Fix:**  
  Use a unique and production-specific `applicationId` (reverse DNS, registered domain if available) and do not leave as `"com.example.*"` in release builds.

---

### 2. **Insecure Build Type Signing Configuration**
- **Observation:**  
  ```groovy
  buildTypes {
      release {
          // TODO: Add your own signing config for the release build.
          // Signing with the debug keys for now, so `flutter run --release` works.
          signingConfig = signingConfigs.debug
      }
  }
  ```
- **Risk:**  
  - **Releases are signed using debug keys**, which are publicly available and shared across all development environments.
  - If release builds are ever distributed (even as tests) with debug keys, **attackers can repackage, modify, or impersonate your app**, bypassing standard update mechanisms and integrity checks.
- **Suggested Fix:**  
  Define and use a **secure, private, production-specific signing config** for all release builds. Never sign production/release builds with the debug key.

---

### 3. **Plugin Management: Automatic Application of Google Services**
- **Observation:**  
  ```groovy
  id 'com.google.gms.google-services'
  ```
- **Risk:**  
  The `google-services` plugin may require the inclusion of secret keys (`google-services.json`), which can be accidentally committed to version control and exposed in public repositories.
- **Suggested Fix:**  
  - **Ensure secret configuration files are never committed to source control** by using `.gitignore` rules.
  - Validate that all API keys are restricted to necessary domains/apps only in the Google Cloud Console.
  - Store API keys and secrets securely.

---

### 4. **Outdated or Hardcoded SDK Versions**
- **Observation:**  
  ```groovy
  minSdk = 23
  ```
- **Risk:**  
  An outdated `minSdk` may expose the application to vulnerabilities present in older versions of the Android platform (API 23 = Android 6.0, 2015). Newer versions offer improved security features (e.g., runtime permissions, security patch backporting).
- **Suggested Fix:**  
  Where possible, **raise the minimum supported SDK version** to benefit from more robust security features.

---

### 5. **Potentially Insecure Gradle Dependencies**
- **Observation:**  
  No explicit version enforcement is present for critical plugins (`kotlin-android`, `com.google.gms.google-services`, etc.).
- **Risk:**  
  If not pinned to specific versions, builds may use outdated dependencies with known security vulnerabilities.
- **Suggested Fix:**  
  Explicitly **pin dependency versions** and keep them up to date. Use dependency scanning tools to monitor for CVEs.

## Summary Table

| Vulnerability                        | Severity   | Fix Recommendation                                               |
|---------------------------------------|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Hardcoded/generic applicationId       | Medium     | Use unique, production-specific package name                      |
| Debug signing used for release builds | Critical   | NEVER sign production/release builds with debug keys              |
| google-services plugin handling       | Medium     | Keep secret files out of VCS, restrict API keys                   |
| Outdated minSdk version               | Medium     | Raise minSdk if possible                                         |
| Unpinned plugin/dependency versions   | Medium     | Pin and regularly update plugin/dependency versions               |

## Additional Recommendations

- **Never store sensitive secrets, API keys, or credentials directly in the build file or repository.**
- **Regularly scan your dependency tree for vulnerable plugins and libraries.**
- **Validate all build and release signing configurationsâ€”treat release keys with the utmost secrecy.**
- **Apply security best practices for third-party plugins and Firebase integration.**
