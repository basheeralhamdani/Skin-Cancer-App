# Critical Code Review Report

### File Type Inspected
- **JSON-based configuration** (likely Firebase `google-services.json` or similar)

---

## 1. **Error: Typo in Storage Bucket URL**
**Issue:**  
The `storage_bucket` key has its value as `"diseas-discover.firebasestorage.app"`.  
The expected Firebase Storage endpoint is **`.appspot.com`**, not `.app`.

**Recommendation:**  
Update the domain to use `.appspot.com` for Firebase Storage usage.

**Corrected Code Line (Pseudo Code):**
```json
"storage_bucket": "diseas-discover.appspot.com"
```

---

## 2. **Security Risk: API Key Hardcoded**
**Issue:**  
API key `AIzaSyBqep8M1PujFLwo9y0BPC7pQ1gYce4u-jo` is present in plain text.

**Recommendation:**  
Consider using environment variables or service account credentials where possible for sensitive values. If this file remains public (as in a mobile app), implement security rules on Firebase and monitor usage/react to key misuse.

---

## 3. **Optimization: Unused Array Property**
**Issue:**  
Empty arrays for `oauth_client` and `other_platform_oauth_client` can be omitted unless there's a processing requirement by the reader (e.g., Firebase).

**Suggested (if optional):**
```json
// Remove the keys entirely if they are not required:
"oauth_client": [ /* removed if optional */ ]
"other_platform_oauth_client": [ /* removed if optional */ ]
```

---

## 4. **Industry Standard: Consistent Naming**
**Issue:**  
The project and package name uses `"diseas"` instead of `"disease"`.  
Check if this is a typo or intentional; typos communicate a lack of attention to detail, and may cause confusion in deployments/configurations.

**Recommendation:**  
Ensure all identifiers are consistently named.

**Corrected Code Line (if typo):**
```json
"project_id": "disease-discover",
"storage_bucket": "disease-discover.appspot.com"
```
_Update similarly in all places; confer with business/product requirements before changing._

---

## 5. **Validation: Configuration Versioning**
**Note:**  
`"configuration_version": "1"` is present, which is correct.

---

## 6. **General Security Practice Reminder**
- Ensure that the API key is restricted in the Google Cloud Console to only necessary APIs and usage origins.
- Secure the Firebase Storage with proper security rules.

| **Issue**                     | **Severity** | **Correction**                                     |
|-------------------------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Typo in storage bucket domain  | High         | Use `.appspot.com`                                 |
| API Key Exposure              | High         | Secure and monitor API key                         |
| Unused empty arrays           | Low          | Omit if possible                                   |
| Naming inconsistency          | Medium       | Correct to `"disease"` if typo                     |

---

## **Action Items**
- ✅ Correct domain name in storage bucket
- ✅ Ensure consistent project/package naming if needed
- ✅ Restrict and monitor API key usage
- ⬜ Remove optional empty arrays if the format allows
