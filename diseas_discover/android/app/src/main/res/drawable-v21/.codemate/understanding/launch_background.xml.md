High-Level Documentation

**Purpose:**
This XML file defines the visual layout for the Android app's launch (splash) screen background. It leverages the layer-list drawable feature to customize what users see immediately when the app is launched, before the main UI is displayed.

**Key Features:**

- **Background Layer:** The splash screen background utilizes the system-defined theme background color (android:colorBackground) as its base layer.
- **Optional Image Asset Layer:** A placeholder (currently commented out) allows developers to easily add a centered image (such as an app logo) by specifying a bitmap resource under @mipmap/launch_image.
- **Customization Point:** Developers can modify this file to tailor the splash screen's appearance by changing the background color, adding images, or including additional visual assets.

**Usage Context:**
This file is typically referenced in the app's manifest (under the splash screen theme) to provide a seamless and visually appealing transition during initial app loading.
