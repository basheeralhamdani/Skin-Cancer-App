# High-Level Documentation

This XML code defines two Android styles (themes) for use in an application, typically a Flutter app running on Android:

## 1. **LaunchTheme**
- **Purpose:** This theme is applied to the app's window during the initial launch phase, especially while the process is starting and before the Flutter engine renders its first frame.
- **Features:** 
  - Inherits from Android's `Theme.Black.NoTitleBar` (a dark theme with no title bar).
  - Sets a drawable resource (`@drawable/launch_background`) as the window background, commonly used for displaying a splash screen.
  - Intended to provide a smooth, visually-appealing transition during app startup, respecting the system dark mode setting.

## 2. **NormalTheme**
- **Purpose:** This theme takes effect right after the process has started and while the Flutter UI is initializing or running.
- **Features:** 
  - Also inherits from `Theme.Black.NoTitleBar`.
  - Uses the system's background color (`?android:colorBackground`) for the window background, ensuring consistency with user/system preferences.
  - Specifically referenced for apps using the V2 Flutter Android embedding.

**General Notes:**
- Both styles are designed to control the visual appearance of the app's window at different initialization stages.
- They help achieve smooth theme transitions and a consistent look and feel when launching a Flutter-based Android app.
