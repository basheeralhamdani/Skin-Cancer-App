# High-Level Documentation

## Purpose
This XML file defines the launch splash screen background for an Android application. The launch screen is displayed immediately when the app is started, providing a seamless user experience as the app loads.

## Structure and Components
- **Root Element:** `<layer-list>`  
  - Specifies a list of drawable layers that overlay each other to compose the background.
- **First Item:**  
  - `<item android:drawable="@android:color/white" />`  
    - Fills the background with a solid white color.
- **Optional Image Asset:**  
  - Commented-out section for inserting a custom splash screen image.
  - Demonstrates how to add a bitmap image (e.g., app logo or branding image) centered on the splash screen using the `@mipmap/launch_image` resource.

## Customization
- Developers can change the background color by replacing `@android:color/white` with a different color resource.
- To add a branded image, uncomment and modify the `<bitmap>` block, specifying the desired image asset.

## Usage
Typically, this file is saved in the `res/drawable` directory of an Android project (e.g., `res/drawable/launch_screen.xml`) and referenced in the appâ€™s theme under `android:windowBackground` to control the appearance of the launch splash screen.
