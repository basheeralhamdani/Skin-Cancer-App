# Security Vulnerability Report

## Code Analyzed

```xml
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
    <!-- The INTERNET permission is required for development. Specifically,
         the Flutter tool needs it to communicate with the running application
         to allow setting breakpoints, to provide hot reload, etc.
    -->
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
</manifest>
```

## Identified Security Vulnerabilities

### 1. Overly Broad INTERNET Permission

- **Description**:  
  The Android app is requesting the `INTERNET` permission, which allows it full access to the network. While necessary for many applications, this permission can significantly broaden the attack surface if network communication is not properly secured elsewhere in the application code.

- **Risks**:
  - Malicious code (if injected or included inadvertently) can send sensitive data over the network.
  - In the absence of secure communication practices (e.g., using only HTTPS, validating server certificates), an attacker could intercept or tamper with the app's data.
  - The permission is a frequent target for exploitation in combination with other vulnerabilities like JavaScript injection or insecure WebViews.

- **Mitigating Recommendations**:
  - Use this permission only if absolutely necessary; do not include it simply for development or debug builds.
  - If the permission is needed only for development (e.g., Flutter hot reload), consider removing it or restricting its use in production builds via build flavors or configuration.
  - Ensure all network communications use secure protocols (HTTPS with certificate validation).
  - Regularly audit application code to ensure no sensitive data is transmitted in plaintext.

| Overly Broad INTERNET Permission    | App can access the internet with no further restriction  | Remove if unnecessary, enforce secure network practices|

## Additional Notes

- This manifest alone does not introduce immediate exploits, but it does grant an application-wide capability whose misuse can lead to major vulnerabilities if not properly managed elsewhere.
- Further static/dynamic analysis of other parts of the application (e.g., WebView usage, data transmission, storage) is recommended to assess true risk.
