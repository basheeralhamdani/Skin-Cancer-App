# High-Level Documentation: IntelliJ IDEA Module Configuration (Android/Flutter)

This configuration file describes the structure and settings of a Java-based module for an Android project, potentially integrating Flutter and Kotlin. It is used by JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA or Android Studio to understand how to organize, build, and manage the project resources.

## Key Components

### 1. Facets
- **Android Facet:** Enables Android-specific features and configuration within the IDE. 
  - Paths for generated source folders, resource folders, libraries, asset folders, and Proguard logs are specified relative to the module directory.
  - The Android manifest, essential for Android apps, is referenced.

### 2. Source and Resource Management
- **Source Folders:** Java and Kotlin source files are kept in standard locations under `app/src/main/java` and `app/src/main/kotlin`.
- **Generated Source Folder:** A `/gen` directory is used for auto-generated code (e.g., from AIDL or APT).
- **Resource Folders:** References for resources (images, layouts, etc.), assets, and libraries are maintained as per typical Android project organization.

### 3. Build and Compiler Output
- The output produced by the compiler is inherited (not custom).
- Any compiler-generated content is excluded as individual output directories.

### 4. SDK and Library Dependencies
- **SDK:** The module uses the Android API 29 platform.
- **Libraries:** The module depends on:
  - "Flutter for Android" (enables Flutter integration on the Android side).
  - "KotlinJavaRuntime" (for Kotlin language support).

## Summary

This configuration enables efficient Android (and Flutter) development using IntelliJ IDEA/Android Studio, defining source structure, output management, SDK version, and key libraries. It ensures the IDE recognizes how to build, run, and organize the multi-language, multi-framework code in the project.
