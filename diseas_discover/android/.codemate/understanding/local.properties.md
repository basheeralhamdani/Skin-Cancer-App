High-Level Documentation

This configuration file is used to define important environment variables and build settings for a Flutter Android project. Hereâ€™s a summary of each setting:

- sdk.dir: Specifies the file system path to the Android SDK installation. This is required for building and running Flutter apps on Android.
- flutter.sdk: Defines the path to the local Flutter SDK on the system. This enables Flutter tooling to locate necessary resources and executables.
- flutter.buildMode: Indicates the build mode used when compiling the Flutter app (e.g., debug, release, or profile). In this case, it is set to debug for development and testing.
- flutter.versionName: Sets the human-readable version name of the Flutter application (e.g., displayed in app stores and device info).
- flutter.versionCode: Assigns the internal version code of the app, which is used for update/versioning purposes on Android platforms.

Overall, this file helps configure the development tools and control the build behavior for a Flutter-based Android application.
