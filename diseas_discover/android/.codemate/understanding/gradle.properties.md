# High-Level Documentation

This configuration appears to be from a Gradle properties file, which is used to specify settings for building Android projects with Gradle. Hereâ€™s a high-level description of its purpose:

1. **JVM Arguments for Gradle (`org.gradle.jvmargs`):**
   - Sets the maximum heap size for the Gradle daemon to 4 GB.
   - Sets the maximum metaspace size for the JVM to 2 GB.
   - Enables automatic heap dumps when the JVM encounters an OutOfMemoryError, aiding in debugging memory issues during build processes.

2. **AndroidX and Jetifier Support:**
   - `android.useAndroidX=true`: Instructs the build system to use AndroidX libraries instead of their legacy Support Library versions, ensuring access to the latest Android features and APIs.
   - `android.enableJetifier=true`: Enables the Jetifier tool, which automatically migrates third-party libraries to use AndroidX, providing compatibility during the transition from Support Libraries to AndroidX.

**Overall Purpose:**  
These settings optimize memory usage for Gradle builds, ensure modern Android APIs (AndroidX) are used throughout the project, and automate compatibility with dependencies that originally used the older Support Libraries.
