High-Level Documentation

This configuration script, written in Gradle's Kotlin DSL or Groovy DSL (for JVM-based project builds), is designed to manage the build environment for a multi-module Android project. Below is an overview of its main responsibilities:

1. **Repository Configuration (allprojects):**
   - Ensures that all modules (projects and subprojects) use Google's Maven repository and Maven Central for resolving dependencies.

2. **Unified Build Directory:**
   - Sets the root projectâ€™s build output directory to `../build`.
   - Configures each subproject to place its build outputs in a dedicated subfolder within the root build directory, thereby centralizing and organizing build artifacts for all modules.

3. **Project Evaluation Order:**
   - Ensures all subprojects are evaluated after the `:app` module (typically the main application), which can be necessary for dependency resolution or for referencing configuration from the app module.

4. **Clean Task Registration:**
   - Defines a custom "clean" task at the root level. When run, this task deletes the entire root build directory, effectively cleaning the build outputs for all modules at once.

**Intended Use:**
This setup is common for Android applications with multiple modules, promoting consistency in dependency management and simplifying housekeeping through centralized build and cleaning logic.
