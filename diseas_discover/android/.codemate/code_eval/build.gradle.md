# Code Review Report

## Summary

This review examines the provided code according to industry standards, best practices in software development, optimization, and potential errors. Recommendations are provided, along with corrected code snippets in pseudo code.

---

### 1. Multiple `subprojects { ... }` Blocks

**Issue:**  
There are separate `subprojects { ... }` blocks, which can reduce readability and may cause maintenance issues.  
**Recommendation:**  
Combine them for clarity and performance.

**Suggested Correction:**
```pseudo
subprojects {
    project.buildDir = "${rootProject.buildDir}/${project.name}"
    project.evaluationDependsOn(":app")
}
```

---

### 2. Hardcoded `buildDir` Path

**Issue:**  
Setting `rootProject.buildDir = "../build"` may lead to inconsistencies if the project location changes or if it conflicts with Gradleâ€™s default behavior.  
**Recommendation:**  
Consider setting the build directory inside the root project directory, and avoid using a relative path outside the project unless required.

**Suggested Correction:**
```pseudo
rootProject.buildDir = "$rootDir/build"
```
*Or keep the default unless there's a strong reason to change it.*

---

### 3. Task Registration for "clean"

**Issue:**  
Redefining the standard `clean` task may cause confusion or unintended behavior, as Gradle already provides a `clean` task by default.  
**Recommendation:**  
If customization is needed, use `tasks.named('clean') { ... }` to configure the existing task, otherwise delete this block.

**Suggested Correction:**
```pseudo
tasks.named("clean") {
    delete rootProject.buildDir
}
```
*Or remove this section entirely if not strictly needed.*

---

### 4. Project Dependency Declaration

**Issue:**  
`project.evaluationDependsOn(":app")` is applied to all subprojects, which may introduce evaluation order issues, especially if not every subproject depends on `:app`.  
**Recommendation:**  
Apply this only to subprojects that do depend on `:app`.

**Suggested Correction:**
```pseudo
subprojects {
    if (project.name != "app") {
        project.evaluationDependsOn(":app")
    }
}
```

---

### 5. Repository Declaration

**Issue:**  
Repositories are correctly set; however, verify if any repositories are needed only for certain projects and not globally.

**Suggested Correction:**
_No correction needed unless restriction required._

| Issue                                       | Correction        | Suggested Pseudo Code           |
|----------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------- |
| Multiple `subprojects` blocks                | Merge blocks      | See Section 1                   |
| Hardcoded `buildDir` path                    | Use `$rootDir`    | See Section 2                   |
| Overriding default `clean` task              | Use `named` or remove| See Section 3               |
| Blanket dependency on `:app` in all subprojects | Apply conditionally | See Section 4                |

## Final Note

Addressing the above points will improve maintainability, reduce the risk of build errors, and align the code with industry standards. Please consider these corrections before proceeding with integration or deployment.
