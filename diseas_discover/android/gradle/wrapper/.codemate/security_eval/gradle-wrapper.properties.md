# Security Vulnerability Report

## Target: Gradle Wrapper Properties

**File Contents:**
```properties
distributionBase=GRADLE_USER_HOME
distributionPath=wrapper/dists
zipStoreBase=GRADLE_USER_HOME
zipStorePath=wrapper/dists
distributionUrl=https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-8.3-all.zip
```

---

## 1. Download Source Integrity

### **Vulnerability**
The `distributionUrl` specifies a remote file for Gradle to download and execute. If this file or the server it resides on is ever compromised, a malicious Gradle distribution could be served and executed on build machines.

### **Potential Impact**
- Remote code execution via a compromised or MITMed Gradle distribution.
- Unintentional exposure to a vulnerable, malicious, or trojaned Gradle executable.

### **Mitigation**
- Always verify downloads with checksums and/or use Gradle Wrapper JARs that are checked into version control.
- Consider pinning the Gradle distribution via SHA256 or signature verification (where possible).
- Use HTTPS to restrict some MITM attacks, but beware of local proxies and attacks on CA trust.

---

## 2. Insecure Protocol

### **Vulnerability**
The `distributionUrl` correctly uses `https://`, which is more secure than `http://`; however, if this was ever changed to `http://`, it would open the system to MITM and code injection.

### **Potential Impact**
- With `http://`, a malicious actor could intercept and modify the distribution during download, leading to code execution.

### **Mitigation**
- Enforce use of `https://` and consider restricting updates to the `gradle-wrapper.properties` file in your CI process.
- Ensure SSL/TLS certificate validation is not bypassed.

---

## 3. Version Pinning & Updates

### **Vulnerability**
The distribution is pinned to `gradle-8.3-all.zip`. If this version becomes outdated, it may miss security patches, exposing the build system to vulnerabilities within Gradle itself.

### **Potential Impact**
- Exposure to known Gradle vulnerabilities due to outdated software.
- Compromise of build system or supply chain attacks.

### **Mitigation**
- Regularly audit and update the `distributionUrl` to keep up with security updates.
- Subscribe to Gradle release notes for CVEs and important fixes.

---

## 4. Untrusted Changes to this File

### **Vulnerability**
If an attacker can modify the `gradle-wrapper.properties` file, they can direct the build process to download a malicious Gradle binary.

### **Potential Impact**
- Full compromise of build environments and codebase via supply chain attack.

### **Mitigation**
- Enforce file integrity checks on this file in CI/CD pipelines.
- Limit write access to this file via version control permissions.
- Mandate code review on changes to this file.

## Summary Table

| Vulnerability                 | Risk                        | Recommendation                        |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Unverified Remote Downloads   | Remote code execution       | Verify downloads, lock wrapper JAR     |
| Insecure Protocol             | MITM/code injection         | Always use HTTPS                       |
| Outdated Version              | Gradle CVEs                 | Regularly update Gradle version        |
| Untrusted File Modification   | Supply chain compromise     | Enforce integrity and access controls  |

---

## Final Recommendations

- Continuously verify and control access to `gradle-wrapper.properties`.
- Keep the Gradle version up to date.
- Use only HTTPS and verify remote server authenticity.
- Consider implementing CI-based validation for this and related files to avoid supply chain attacks.
