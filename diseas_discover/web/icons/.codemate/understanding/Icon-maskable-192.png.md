# High-Level Documentation

## Overview

The provided code is **binary data representing a PNG image file**. It contains the standard PNG header, followed by compressed image data and the required PNG chunks (such as IHDR, IDAT, and IEND). This is not an executable script or application code; instead, it is a raw image file encoded in the PNG format.

## High-Level Description

- **Format:** Portable Network Graphics (PNG) image
- **Purpose:** Used for lossless image storage and transfer
- **Structure:**
  - PNG signature (header) identifies the file as a PNG image.
  - **IHDR chunk:** Contains image metadata such as width, height, bit depth, and color type.
  - **IDAT chunk(s):** Contains the main image pixel data (compressed).
  - **IEND chunk:** Marks the end of the PNG file.
- **Contents:** All visible "code" is actually compressed and encoded image data â€“ not source code or logic.
