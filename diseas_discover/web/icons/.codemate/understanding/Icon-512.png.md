# High-Level Documentation: PNG File Structure (with Embedded EXIF Data)

This file is **not code**, but rather a **binary PNG image file** with embedded metadata. Here is a high-level overview of its contents and structure:

---

## File Type and Structure

- **File Type:** PNG (Portable Network Graphics)
- **Headers:**
  - The file starts with the PNG signature: `\x89PNG\r\n\x1A\n`
  - Standard PNG chunks follow:
    - **IHDR:** Image header defining image width, height, color type, bit depth, compression, filter, and interlace method.
    - **zTXt:** Compressed text chunk, here used for embedding EXIF (Exchangeable Image File Format) "Raw profile type exif" data.
    - **IDAT:** Contains the actual image data, possibly split over multiple chunks, compressed using zlib/deflate.
    - **IEND:** Marks the end of the PNG datastream.

## Embedded Metadata

- **EXIF Data:**
  - Present inside a `zTXt` chunk. The EXIF metadata includes information typical of photographs (date, time, device, camera settings, etc.). This is usually used by image editing and display software.

## Image Data

- **IDAT Chunk(s):**
  - Contains raster data for the bitmap. This is compressed pixel data interpreted according to the IHDR settings.
- **Image Properties:**
  - From the header bytes (not fully decoded here): the image is likely 2x2 pixels, 8 bits per channel, color type 2 (Truecolor/RGB), and no alpha channel.

## Notable Features

- **Binary File:** This is not meant to be read as source code or plaintext data.
- **Embedded Profile:** The zTXt chunk for "Raw profile type exif" is used to store EXIF metadata, which is uncommon for PNG (more common in JPEG), but allowed.

## Common Applications

- **Digital Imaging:** Used for storing and sharing images with additional metadata.
- **Metadata Extraction:** Tools can read the zTXt EXIF data for processing or display.
- **Web and UI:** PNG is a standard web format supported by all modern browsers and image viewers.

## Summary

This "code" is actually a PNG image file with:
- Header information describing its pixel data format.
- Embedded, compressed EXIF metadata for extended image attributes.
- Compressed image data.
- Proper file termination (IEND chunk).

**This file is meant to be interpreted by image-handling libraries and applications, not executed or run as source code.**
