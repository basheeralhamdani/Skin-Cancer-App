# Security Vulnerability Report

**File:** CMakeLists.txt (excerpt)  
**Project:** runner  
**Review Focus:** Security Vulnerabilities in Build Configuration  
**Date:** 2024-06-14

---

## 1. Use of Hardcoded Paths

**Finding:**  
Source files and include directories are referenced directly based on project/source directories. While generally acceptable, any of these paths (especially `${FLUTTER_MANAGED_DIR}`) should be validated to ensure they are not user-supplied or attacker-controlled to avoid arbitrary file inclusion or code execution risk during build.

**Recommendation:**  
Ensure all referenced paths (including variables) are securely set, well-controlled, and cannot be manipulated by untrusted sources.

---

## 2. Absence of Compiler Hardenings

**Finding:**  
The configuration does not explicitly enable compiler settings for enhanced security, such as stack protection, buffer overrun checks, or control flow guard. This may leave the binaries more vulnerable to common attacks.

**Recommendation:**  
Explicitly add safe compiler flags:
```cmake
# Example for MSVC
target_compile_options(${BINARY_NAME} PRIVATE /GS /guard:cf)
# Example for GCC/Clang
target_compile_options(${BINARY_NAME} PRIVATE -fstack-protector-strong -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2)
```
Moreover, ensure the use of **/DYNAMICBASE** and **/NXCOMPAT** linker options for Windows for ASLR and Data Execution Prevention.

---

## 3. Insecure Preprocessor Definitions

**Finding:**  
The `FLUTTER_VERSION` (and related variables) are passed as preprocessor definitions. If they come from user-supplied sources (even indirectly, e.g., via environment variables or external scripts), they could potentially be used for macro injection or to alter program logic at compile time.

**Recommendation:**  
Validate the source of all version and configuration variables used in preprocessor definitions to ensure they are not attacker-controlled.

---

## 4. Linking with External Libraries

**Finding:**  
The project links with `flutter`, `flutter_wrapper_app`, and `"dwmapi.lib"`. There are no checks on version, integrity, or authenticity of these libraries in this build script. Malicious or outdated libraries could be introduced.

**Recommendation:**  
- Use cryptographically signed dependencies where possible.
- Document and pin exact versions of libraries in use.
- Maintain a process for regularly updating and auditing third-party dependencies.

---

## 5. Lack of Output Sanitization

**Finding:**  
There is no check for the integrity of the files referenced for compilation (manifest, .rc, generated code, etc.). Without checks, an attacker with write access might inject malicious code.

**Recommendation:**  
During CI/CD, verify the integrity and origin of all source and resource files used in this build.

---

## 6. CMake Script Injection Risk

**Finding:**  
No indication of input sanitization for `${BINARY_NAME}`, `${FLUTTER_VERSION}`, or other variables. If these could be set by untrusted sources, this could lead to code injection into the build system.

**Recommendation:**  
Ensure all CMake variables and arguments are derived from trusted, fixed sources, not from user, external, or environment input that is not properly sanitized.

---

## 7. Debug Symbols and Release Flags

**Finding:**  
There is no explicit build type enforcement. Accidentally shipping a debug build can expose sensitive symbols or bring insecure settings.

**Recommendation:**  
Enforce `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE Release` for production builds and strip debug symbols unless explicitly required.

# Final Recommendations

- **Harden the build:** Add compiler and linker security flags.
- **Review all input variables:** Ensure all variables passed to CMake are trusted.
- **Audit dependencies:** Always use trusted, verified third-party libraries.
- **Sanitize paths and sources:** Validate all paths/files referenced from variable sources.
- **Implement CI/CD checks:** Enforce security steps in automated builds.
