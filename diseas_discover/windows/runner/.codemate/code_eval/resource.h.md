# Critical Review Report

## File: Runner.rc (Resource Header)

---

### 1. Industry Standards & Best Practices

#### Issue: Incomplete Header Guards

The code uses `#ifdef APSTUDIO_INVOKED` and related directives to protect "Next default values" but **does not provide full header guards** for the entire file content, which is a best practice in C/C++ resource and header files to prevent double-inclusion.

**Suggested Code:**
```c
#ifndef RUNNER_RC_INCLUDED
#define RUNNER_RC_INCLUDED
// ... entire content ...
#endif
```

---

### 2. Comments and Documentation

#### Issue: Inconsistent or Insufficient Comments

- The initial comment refers to C++-specific behavior in a resource file. For improved clarity, always mention that this is a resource header file, auto-generated, and should not be manually modified (if that's the case).
- Indicate the purpose of each block more clearly.

**Suggested Code:**
```c
// Resource definitions for Runner.exe
// NOTE: This file is generated by Microsoft Visual C++.
//       Do not modify manually unless necessary.
```

### 3. Unoptimized and Duplicated Definitions

#### Issue: Redundant or Unnecessary Resource Definitions

- `_APS_NEXT_RESOURCE_VALUE`, `_APS_NEXT_COMMAND_VALUE`, etc., are reserved "next values" for resource editors (like Visual Studio). 
- If extending definitions or adding custom resources, define them **immediately after existing ones** to avoid resource ID conflicts.

**Suggested Code:**
```c
#define IDD_RUNNER_DIALOG                102   // Example: next resource dialog ID, if planning to add dialogs
```

---

### 4. Error Checking

#### Issue: Lack of Error Checking and Versioning

- Resource header files may benefit from a version identifier or at least a version comment to track updates.
- Consider adding a version tag in a comment, e.g.:

**Suggested Code:**
```c
// Version: 1.0.0   Updated: 2024-06-01
```

---

### 5. Formatting

#### Issue: Formatting Consistency

- Ensure consistent alignment of comments and macro values for readability.
- Remove excessively wide comment lines and unnecessary indentation.

**Suggested Code:**
```c
#define IDI_APP_ICON 101    // Application Icon
```
