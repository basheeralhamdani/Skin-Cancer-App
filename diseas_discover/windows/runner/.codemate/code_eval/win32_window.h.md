# Code Review Report

## File: `RUNNER_WIN32_WINDOW_H_`

---

### 1. Use of `unsigned int` for `Point` and `Size` Coordinates

**Issue:**
Coordinates and sizes in Windows are typically signed (`int`) to accommodate negative positions, e.g., when a window is partially off-screen. Using `unsigned int` can cause issues with standard Win32 APIs and lead to unexpected behavior.

**Correction:**
```cpp
// Suggested correction for struct Point and Size:
struct Point {
  int x;
  int y;
  Point(int x, int y) : x(x), y(y) {}
};

struct Size {
  int width;
  int height;
  Size(int width, int height) : width(width), height(height) {}
};
```

---

### 2. Rule of 5 Compliance and Resource Management

**Issue:**
The class manages a handle (`HWND`). Since it defines a destructor, we should consider explicitly deleting or implementing copy/move constructors/assignment operators to prevent accidental copying/moving which may lead to resource leaks or double free.

**Correction:**
```cpp
// In private section
Win32Window(const Win32Window&) = delete;
Win32Window& operator=(const Win32Window&) = delete;
Win32Window(Win32Window&&) = delete;
Win32Window& operator=(Win32Window&&) = delete;
```

---

### 3. Inconsistent Method Naming and Documentation

**Issue:**
Method `Create` is documented as “Creates a win32 window” but it is not named as `CreateAndShow` in the comment for `OnCreate`. Ensure consistency throughout the code and documentation. Consider renaming or correcting the comment.

**Correction:**
```cpp
// Update comment for OnCreate:
 // Called when Create is called, allowing subclass window-related
```

---

### 4. Const-correctness

**Issue:**
Getter methods such as `GetHandle` and `GetClientArea` should be marked as `const` to indicate that they don’t modify the class state.

**Correction:**
```cpp
HWND GetHandle() const;
RECT GetClientArea() const;
```

---

### 5. Virtual Destructor

**Good Practice:**
Already present: The destructor is `virtual` which is correct for a base class with virtual methods.

---

### 6. Initialization of Member Variables

**Good Practice:**
All member variables are in-class initialized. This is modern and recommended.

---

### 7. Exception Safety

**Observation:**
While most methods are simple wrappers, the destructors, and any resource-releasing methods like `Destroy` should be exception safe. Use `noexcept` for the destructor if possible.

**Correction:**
```cpp
// If possible, declare the destructor as noexcept:
virtual ~Win32Window() noexcept;
```

---

### 8. Redundant `public` Inheritance in Constructors

**Issue:**
No issue here; just a note that class uses standard C++ inheritance/documentation.

---

### 9. Potential for Smart Pointer Usage

**Observation:**
HWND is a raw OS handle and should not be managed with smart pointers, so current usage is appropriate.

---

### 10. Private Member Variables Naming Convention

**Recommendation:**
Current convention (trailing underscore) is consistent.

---

---

## Summary

- Use `int` for coordinates and sizes.
- Explicitly delete copy/move constructors and assignment operators.
- Const-correct getter methods.
- Ensure comment consistency.
- Consider marking the destructor as `noexcept`.

---

### All Suggested Code Corrections (Pseudo Code)

```cpp
// 1. Structs: Use int for coordinates and sizes
struct Point { int x, y; Point(int x, int y) : x(x), y(y) {} };
struct Size { int width, height; Size(int width, int height) : width(width), height(height) {} };

// 2. Rule of 5, in private section:
Win32Window(const Win32Window&) = delete;
Win32Window& operator=(const Win32Window&) = delete;
Win32Window(Win32Window&&) = delete;
Win32Window& operator=(Win32Window&&) = delete;

// 3. Consistent commenting for OnCreate
// Called when Create is called, allowing subclass window-related

// 4. Const-correctness for getters
HWND GetHandle() const;
RECT GetClientArea() const;

// 5. Destructor noexcept if possible
virtual ~Win32Window() noexcept;
```
