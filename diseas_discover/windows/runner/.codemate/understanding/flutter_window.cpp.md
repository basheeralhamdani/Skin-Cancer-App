# High-Level Documentation: `flutter_window.cpp`

## Overview
This code defines the `FlutterWindow` class, which manages a native Windows window that embeds a Flutter application. It handles window creation, message processing, and the lifecycle management required to run and interact with a Flutter engine within a Win32 application.

## Major Components

1. **Construction & Destruction**
    - The class is constructed with a reference to Flutter project configuration.
    - On destruction, it cleans up the Flutter controller.

2. **Window Lifecycle**
    - `OnCreate()`: Initializes the base window and then creates and configures the Flutter view controller to embed Flutter content into the window.
    - Handles Flutter engine setup, plugin registration, child content assignment, and ensures the window is shown properly when the first Flutter frame is ready.
    - `OnDestroy()`: Cleans up the Flutter controller and performs any additional shutdown required by the base window class.

3. **Windows Message Handling**
    - `MessageHandler()`: Intercepts Windows messages for the window.
        - Gives Flutter engine/plugins a chance to handle the message first.
        - Handles specific messages (e.g., font changes) directly.
        - Forwards remaining messages to the base window class.

## Key Responsibilities
- Hosts and manages a native window for Flutter.
- Initializes Flutter engine and view.
- Registers required plugins.
- Integrates with native Windows message loop, delegating as appropriate to Flutter or default handlers.
- Handles redraw/show logic to synchronize with Flutter's frame rendering.

## Intended Usage
This class is intended to be used as the main window for a Windows-based Flutter desktop application. It manages window creation, Flutter engine integration, and correct message routing between the Windows and Flutter runtimes.
