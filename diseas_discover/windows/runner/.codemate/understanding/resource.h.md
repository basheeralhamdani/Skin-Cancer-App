**High-Level Documentation**

This file is a Visual C++ resource header file, typically generated by the Microsoft Visual Studio Resource Editor. It defines symbolic constants for resources used in a Windows application.

**Purpose:**
- To provide unique identifiers for application resources, such as icons, dialogs, menus, etc.
- Facilitates resource management in C++ projects.

**Key Elements:**
- `IDI_APP_ICON` (value 101): Assigns a unique identifier to an application icon resource used in the project.
- Default macro values for new resources, commands, controls, and symbols, aiding future resource expansion.

**Usage Context:**
- Included in C++ source files to refer programmatically to resources, ensuring maintainability and consistency.
- Used by the resource compiler (`rc`) and resource editor tools, not by end users.

**Modification Notes:**
- Values should only be changed through the resource editor to prevent conflicts or errors. 
- Developers add new resources and update these identifiers automatically through the IDE.

**Summary:**
This file manages resources for a C++ Windows application, enabling straightforward reference and modification of UI elements and assets within the development environment.
