# High-Level Documentation of `flutter_window.h`

## Overview

`flutter_window.h` defines the `FlutterWindow` class, a specialized window in a Windows desktop application that serves exclusively as a host for a Flutter view. This class inherits from `Win32Window` and integrates the Flutter engine with a traditional Win32 application window, allowing Flutter content to be rendered and interacted with inside the native application.

## Key Features

- **Integration with Flutter:** Hosts a Flutter view controller, enabling the display and management of Flutter content within a Windows window.
- **Project Management:** Accepts a `flutter::DartProject`, representing the Flutter application to run.
- **Lifecycle Handling:** Overrides window creation and destruction methods to properly initialize and dispose of the Flutter instance.
- **Custom Message Handling:** Processes native Windows messages to support interaction and correct event flow between Win32 and Flutter.

## Core Components

- **Constructor/Destructor:** 
  - The constructor accepts a `flutter::DartProject` instance and initializes the window for Flutter.
  - The destructor ensures proper cleanup of Flutter resources.

- **Key Methods (Protected):**
  - `OnCreate()`: Initializes the Flutter view/controller when the window is created.
  - `OnDestroy()`: Cleans up Flutter resources when the window is destroyed.
  - `MessageHandler()`: Handles Windows messages, enabling communication and event propagation.

- **Private Members:**
  - `project_`: Stores the Flutter project to be executed.
  - `flutter_controller_`: Holds the Flutter view controller instance managing the Flutter app within the window.

## Usage Summary

Developers use `FlutterWindow` as the main window for embedding a Flutter application into a native Windows app. It abstracts the setup and teardown of the Flutter engine within the familiar Win32 environment, simplifying the process of delivering a hybrid desktop application with a Flutter-powered UI.
