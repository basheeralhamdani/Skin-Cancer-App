# High-Level Documentation for Resource Script

This is a Microsoft Visual C++ resource script file (`.rc`), used for defining and managing application resources for a Windows program. It provides configuration for application icons, versioning, and other metadata that are embedded in the executable. Below is a high-level overview of what this script does:

## Overview

- **Purpose:**  
  Establishes resources (icon, version information, and string tables) for a Windows application named `diseas_discover`.
- **Usage Context:**  
  Automatically generated and updated by Microsoft Visual C++ and is usually included in desktop application projects.

## Key Components

### 1. Preprocessing and Includes

- **Character Set:**  
  Sets the code page to `65001` (UTF-8).
- **Header Includes:**  
  References `resource.h` and `winres.h` for resource identifiers and Windows resource definitions.

### 2. Localization

- **Language:**  
  Targets English (United States) resources.

### 3. TEXTINCLUDE Sections

- **Purpose:**  
  Provides file inclusions for resource editors and tools, ensuring `resource.h` and `winres.h` are properly recognized.

### 4. Icon Resource

- **Definition:**  
  Assigns `IDI_APP_ICON` to the file `resources\app_icon.ico`.
- **Function:**  
  This icon is used as the application icon within Windows (e.g., .exe icon, taskbar, etc.).

### 5. Version Information Block

- **Automatic Versioning:**  
  If FLUTTER version macros are provided (`FLUTTER_VERSION_MAJOR, _MINOR, _PATCH, _BUILD`), the version numbers and strings are defined accordingly. If not, falls back to a default of `1.0.0.0`.
- **Fields Included:**  
  - `CompanyName`: com.example
  - `FileDescription`: diseas_discover
  - `FileVersion`: (from macro or default)
  - `InternalName`: diseas_discover
  - `LegalCopyright`
  - `OriginalFilename`: diseas_discover.exe
  - `ProductName`: diseas_discover
  - `ProductVersion`
- **Build Configuration:**  
  Sets a debug flag if `_DEBUG` is defined.

### 6. VarFileInfo

- **Translation Field:**  
  Declares language and code page (`0x409` for US English, code page 1252).

## Additional Details

- **Resource Management:**  
  The script follows conventions to ensure resource IDs do not conflict and resources are compatible across Windows systems.
- **Tool Integration:**  
  Structured for use with Visual C++ resource editors.
