# High-Level Documentation

## Overview

This file is a generated C++ header file for a Flutter application. It is responsible for registering native (C++) plugins with the Flutter engine on desktop platforms. The code provides declarations necessary for integrating plugin functionality into the application and is not intended to be edited manually.

## Functionality

- Declares the function `RegisterPlugins`, which will handle the registration of all plugins used by the application.
- Includes the required Flutter header, `<flutter/plugin_registry.h>`, providing access to the plugin registry interface.
- Uses include guards (`#ifndef`, `#define`, `#endif`) to prevent multiple inclusions of this header file.

## Usage

- This header is included by the main part of the Flutter desktop application.
- The actual registration logic will be implemented in a corresponding source (.cpp) file, usually also generated.
- Ensures that plugins are made available to Flutter code by registering them with the engine at startup.
