# High-Level Documentation

**Purpose:**  
This script is a CMake configuration file for a Flutter desktop (Windows) project. It manages the integration of Flutter plugins into the build process, specifically handling traditional and FFI (Foreign Function Interface) plugins.

**Key Actions:**

1. **Lists Plugins:**  
   - Maintains a list of Flutter plugins to be included in the project (e.g., `cloud_firestore`, `firebase_auth`, etc.).
   - Maintains a separate (empty in this case) list for FFI plugins.

2. **Includes Plugin Subdirectories:**  
   - For each plugin, adds its Windows-specific implementation as a subdirectory to the build, using symbolic links created by Flutter tools.

3. **Links Plugins to Main Binary:**  
   - Links each standard plugin's implementation library to the main application binary.

4. **Tracks Bundled Libraries:**  
   - Collects the output binaries or additional libraries produced by each plugin, so they can be properly bundled or distributed with the main app.

5. **Handles FFI Plugins Separately:**  
   - Provides similar handling for FFI plugins (if any), ensuring their libraries are also bundled.

**Important Notes:**

- **Generated File:** This file is auto-generated by Flutter tooling; manual edits will be overwritten.
- **Project Context:** Used in the build process of a Windows Flutter app, ensuring all necessary native plugin components are built and packaged.

**Summary:**  
The script automates the build integration of Windows-specific native plugins (including bundling their outputs) into a Flutter desktop app using CMake.
