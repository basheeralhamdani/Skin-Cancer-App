# Security Vulnerability Report for Provided CMake Code

This report removes all general analysis and reviews the provided CMake configuration **only** from a security perspective. Below are the findings related to possible security vulnerabilities, potential attack vectors, insecure practices, and improvements that can be made.

---

## 1. Use of External/Generated Files

### **Finding**
```cmake
include(${EPHEMERAL_DIR}/generated_config.cmake)
```
- If `ephemeral/generated_config.cmake` is user-controlled (e.g., written by a preceding tool, untrusted code, or not verified), it can introduce arbitrary CMake code and execute at configuration time — a powerful Remote Code Execution (RCE) vector.

### **Recommendation**
- Ensure only trusted sources generate or produce `generated_config.cmake`.
- Apply strict (chmod 600) file permissions if possible.
- Perform validation or checksum verification before including the file.


## 2. Use of Variables Without Quoting

### **Finding**
Several places use variables in commands without quoting (e.g., `${FLUTTER_ROOT}/packages/flutter_tools/bin/tool_backend.bat`). If any variable is untrusted and manipulated (possibly through environmental attacks), command injection is possible.

### **Example**
```cmake
COMMAND ${CMAKE_COMMAND} -E env
    ${FLUTTER_TOOL_ENVIRONMENT}
    "${FLUTTER_ROOT}/packages/flutter_tools/bin/tool_backend.bat"
      ${FLUTTER_TARGET_PLATFORM} $<CONFIG>
```

If `${FLUTTER_TOOL_ENVIRONMENT}`, `${FLUTTER_ROOT}`, or `${FLUTTER_TARGET_PLATFORM}` can be set from external sources, they could potentially inject arbitrary commands or change build behavior.

### **Recommendation**
- Always closely audit any external inputs populating such variables.
- Quote variables where possible to avoid whitespace or special-character injection.


## 3. Use of Unvalidated Environment

### **Finding**
```cmake
COMMAND ${CMAKE_COMMAND} -E env
    ${FLUTTER_TOOL_ENVIRONMENT}
    ...
```
- If `FLUTTER_TOOL_ENVIRONMENT` is user-controllable or not sanitized, environmental variables such as `PATH`, `LD_PRELOAD`, or `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES` could be injected to escalate privileges or cause arbitrary code execution during the build.

### **Recommendation**
- Whitelist only necessary variables in `FLUTTER_TOOL_ENVIRONMENT`.
- Avoid passing through a bulk environment definition; specify only required variables.


## 4. Untrusted Inputs in Paths

### **Finding**
Variables like `PROJECT_DIR`, `EPHEMERAL_DIR`, `WRAPPER_ROOT`, etc., are used for building paths. If any are derived from untrusted input (e.g., user-supplied CMake options or environment variables), attackers could perform:
- Path Traversal Attacks (e.g., `../../../../etc/shadow`)
- File Overwrite/Read

### **Recommendation**
- Strictly sanitize all input variables for path components.
- Consider restricting or validating all CMake cache and environment variables used in path construction.


## 5. Code/Library Injection Risk

### **Finding**
The build creates targets from source file lists (`add_library(...)`) that are assembled by prepending directories (“${WRAPPER_ROOT}/...”). If any portion of the source file list is user-specified via a variable, an attacker could cause malicious files to be compiled or linked.

### **Recommendation**
- Lock down all variables used to generate file lists to trusted sources.
- Avoid allowing user input (CMake cache, environment, or arguments) to control these variables unless strictly sanitized.


## 6. Use of `add_custom_command` Without Input/Output Control

### **Finding**
The custom command is spoofed as always running with an intentionally symbolic `_phony_` file. This could be manipulated for build pollution, race conditions, or spoofed output.

### **Recommendation**
- Confirm that no untrusted user can write to `${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}` or `_phony_`.
- Consider stricter output handling.

## **Summary Table**

| Issue Area                           | Risk  | Suggested Remediation                      |
|---------------------------------------|-------|--------------------------------------------|
| Inclusion of generated CMake scripts  | High  | Restrict+verify file sources/permissions   |
| Unquoted/unsanitized variables        | Med   | Quote variables and sanitize inputs        |
| Unfiltered environment variables      | High  | Whitelist and validate environment         |
| Untrusted input in build paths        | High? | Limit/sanitize all user/environment input  |
| Source/library file list injection    | High  | Lock down variable generation of lists     |
| Reliance on `_phony_` output          | Low   | Control directory permissions              |

## **Final Recommendations**

- **Ensure ALL files included or referenced by the build are from trusted, immutable, and pre-verified sources.**
- **Disallow untrusted users from writing to any directory or file referenced by these build scripts.**
- **Never pass env/command/filepath variables from untrusted users unsanitized.**
- **Consider implementing a pre-build audit for environment and variables (e.g., with a CMake script or external validation step).**

**If any of the mentioned variables or files is settable by an untrusted user or is not protected by file-system or build-system policy, this build script presents a serious RCE risk.**
