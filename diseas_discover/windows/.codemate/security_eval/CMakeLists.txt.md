# Security Vulnerability Report

## Target: Provided CMake Configuration

Below is an analysis of **security vulnerabilities** present within the provided CMake code. The report exclusively covers security-relevant concerns and does not address style, maintainability, or functionality issues unless they have a direct security impact.

---

### 1. **Permissions and Location of Installed Files**

- **Observation**: The `install` commands write runtime files, assets, and bundled libraries directly into `${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}` (which is forced to be `$<TARGET_FILE_DIR:${BINARY_NAME}>` by default).
- **Vulnerability**: If this installation directory is user-writable (e.g., in the user's home directory or a temporary build directory), malicious tampering with installed files is possible:
    - Attacker could replace or modify runtime dependencies.
    - Native assets, if not validated or signed, could be injected with malicious code.
    - Libraries in user-writable locations can be hijacked, leading to DLL preloading or similar attacks.
- **Mitigation**: Ensure that:
    - Installation directories are set to trusted, administrator/root-controlled locations in deployment scenarios.
    - Apply strict filesystem ACLs to prevent unauthorized modification after installation.
    - Use code signing for native binaries, assets, and bundles.

---

### 2. **Native Asset Copying**

- **Observation**: Native assets are recursively copied via:
    ```cmake
    install(DIRECTORY "${NATIVE_ASSETS_DIR}"
      DESTINATION "${INSTALL_BUNDLE_LIB_DIR}"
      COMPONENT Runtime)
    ```
- **Vulnerability**: There is no integrity validation of the contents of `${NATIVE_ASSETS_DIR}`. If this directory can be influenced (e.g., is generated as part of a build process or via untrusted scripts), an attacker could place malicious shared libraries or binaries to be shipped with the application.
- **Mitigation**:
    - Only copy assets from trusted and well-controlled build source locations.
    - Consider adding cryptographic integrity checks or digital signatures to ensure provenance.

---

### 3. **Batch Asset Removal and Copy**

- **Observation**: The following code completely removes an assets directory and re-copies it:
    ```cmake
    install(CODE "
      file(REMOVE_RECURSE \"${INSTALL_BUNDLE_DATA_DIR}/${FLUTTER_ASSET_DIR_NAME}\")
      " COMPONENT Runtime)
    install(DIRECTORY "${PROJECT_BUILD_DIR}/${FLUTTER_ASSET_DIR_NAME}"
      DESTINATION "${INSTALL_BUNDLE_DATA_DIR}" COMPONENT Runtime)
    ```
- **Vulnerability**: If the source directory or build directory is accessible to unprivileged users, or is not sanitized, there is a risk for local privilege escalation, race conditions, or time-of-check/time-of-use (TOCTOU) attacks. An attacker might insert malicious files right before copying.
- **Mitigation**:
    - Ensure the build process and its directories are secured and not accessible by unauthorized users.
    - Consider performing atomic deploys or verifying files after copy.

---

### 4. **Unvalidated External Inputs**

- **Observation**: Many variables (`PLUGIN_BUNDLED_LIBRARIES`, `${FLUTTER_ICU_DATA_FILE}`, `${FLUTTER_LIBRARY}`, `${AOT_LIBRARY}`) may reference files generated or introduced earlier in the build process, potentially through third-party sources or plugins.
- **Vulnerability**: If these files are not validated, an attacker could introduce malicious code through compromised plugins or libraries that are automatically included in the build and shipped with the final executable.
- **Mitigation**:
    - Verify and validate all third-party plugin source code and artifacts.
    - Where possible, restrict which plugins or libraries can be bundled.
    - Use secure supply-chain practices (hashes, signatures, trusted sources, etc).

---

### 5. **No Specific Build Hardening Flags**

- **Observation**: Security-related build hardening flags (e.g., `/GS`, `/DYNAMICBASE`, `/NXCOMPAT`, or relevant linker security flags for CMake on Windows) are not explicitly set.
- **Vulnerability**: Produced binaries may be missing key modern security protections (stack protection, ASLR, DEP/NX, etc.).
- **Mitigation**:
    - Explicitly set the relevant compile and linker flags to ensure use of security hardening features for all builds.
    - For Microsoft compilers, add `/GS`, `/guard:cf`, `/DYNAMICBASE`, `/NXCOMPAT`, and ensure `/INTEGRITYCHECK` as appropriate.

---

### 6. **Debug Builds Set as Default**

- **Observation**:
    ```cmake
    if(NOT CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE AND NOT CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES)
      set(CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE "Debug" CACHE
        STRING "Flutter build mode" FORCE)
    ```
- **Vulnerability**: Building and deploying Debug builds by default exposes symbols, disables certain optimizations and sometimes disables key security mitigations (e.g., anti-exploit measures). In some cases, debug builds may include sensitive information (paths, secrets).
- **Mitigation**:
    - Set Release as the default for production or automate checks to ensure Debug builds are never shipped.
    - Ensure production builds are stripped of debug symbols and are hardened.

## **Recommendations**

Refer to the mitigation columns above as appropriate. Additional suggestions include:

- Integrate a security review/checklist into your build/release process.
- Use a supply-chain security scanning service or tool to audit third-party dependencies and build scripts.
- Ensure secure permissions on all build, install, and asset directories.
- Consider SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) practices for traceability.
