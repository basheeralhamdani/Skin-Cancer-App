# High-Level Documentation

This document is a `.gitignore` file typically used in projects developed with Flutter and Xcode (iOS/macOS development). Its purpose is to instruct Git to ignore files and directories that are:

- **User-specific, local configuration, or temporary files** that shouldn't be versioned, such as:
  - IDE/editor state files (e.g., Xcodeâ€™s `.xcuserdata`, `.pbxuser`, `.mode*v3`, etc.)
  - Build artifacts and generated files (e.g., `DerivedData/`, `.generated/`, `Flutter/*.framework`, `Flutter/app.flx`, etc.)
  - Dependency directories (e.g., `Pods/`, `.symlinks/`)
  - Synchronization or cache folders (e.g., `*sync/`, `.vagrant/`)

- **Special cases**: Some exceptions at the end permit certain default Xcode project files (`default.mode1v3`, etc.) to be versioned if needed.

Overall, this configuration ensures that only essential source and project files are tracked in version control, avoiding clutter and reducing the risk of sharing system-dependent or recreated files.
