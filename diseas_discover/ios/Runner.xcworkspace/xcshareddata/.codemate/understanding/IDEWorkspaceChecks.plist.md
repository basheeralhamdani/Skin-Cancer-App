High-Level Documentation

This file is a property list (plist) in XML format used by Apple development tools (such as Xcode).

Purpose:
The plist defines settings or metadata for a project or component. In this particular file, the dictionary key IDEDidComputeMac32BitWarning is set to true.

Functionality:
- The presence of the IDEDidComputeMac32BitWarning key with a value of true indicates that the development environment (IDE) — likely Xcode — has already checked for 32-bit macOS build compatibility and has issued a warning or assessed the issue.
- This prevents the warning from being repeatedly shown, streamlining the developer experience and reducing redundant notifications.

Typical Usage:
- Managed automatically by the IDE.
- Rarely edited manually; serves mainly as an internal project state indicator for IDE behavior.

No application logic or code execution is present in this file—it solely stores a configuration state.
