High-Level Documentation

Overview:
This XML code defines metadata for an Xcode workspace. An Xcode workspace is a container that encapsulates multiple related Xcode projects, enabling structured management and shared resources among them.

Key Components:

1. Root Element - Workspace:
   - Marks the document as an Xcode workspace definition.
   - Contains a version attribute to specify schema/version compatibility.

2. File Reference - FileRef:
   - Points to one or more Xcode project files (.xcodeproj) to be included in the workspace.
   - In this case, it references Runner.xcodeproj, indicating that this project is grouped under the current workspace.

Purpose:
The file primarily serves as a manifest, allowing Xcode to recognize which projects are part of the workspace. This supports collaborative development, modular code organization, and shared schemes or build configurations.

Common Use Case:
Such workspace files are typically found in app projects generated by tools like Flutter, or in complex iOS/macOS projects with multiple modules, extensions, or libraries. This sample shows a minimal workspace configuration referencing a single project.
