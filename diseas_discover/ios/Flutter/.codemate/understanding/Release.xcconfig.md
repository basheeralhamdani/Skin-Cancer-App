**Purpose:**  
This code includes a configuration file named `Generated.xcconfig`. The purpose of this file is to import build settings for a project, typically within an Xcode environment.

**How It Works:**  
- The `#include "Generated.xcconfig"` directive tells the preprocessor to include the contents of the `Generated.xcconfig` file at this location.
- `.xcconfig` files are often used to define and manage build configuration settings such as compiler flags, resource paths, and build options in Xcode projects.

**Typical Usage Scenario:**  
- `Generated.xcconfig` may be generated automatically as part of a build pipeline to inject dynamic or environment-specific build settings.
- By including this file in your configuration, you ensure that any variables or settings defined in it become part of the current build configuration.

**Benefits:**  
- Centralizes and streamlines build configuration management.
- Facilitates automation and dynamic configuration via generated files.
- Improves maintainability by decoupling build settings from code.

**Note:**  
This code does not contain any logic itself; it simply imports configuration data from an external file.
