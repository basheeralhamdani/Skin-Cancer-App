**High-Level Documentation**

## Overview

This code consists of a single line:

```cpp
#include "Generated.xcconfig"
```

---

## Purpose

- **Include Directive:**  
  The code uses the `#include` preprocessor directive to incorporate the contents of the file named `Generated.xcconfig` into the source file during preprocessing.

---

## High-Level Functionality

- **Configuration Integration:**  
  By including `Generated.xcconfig`, the code is able to import definitions, settings, or configurations specified in that file. This is commonly used to separate configuration data (such as compiler flags, environment settings, or macros) from the main source code.

- **Build-Time Customization:**  
  The filename `Generated.xcconfig` suggests that this file is generated, possibly during the build process, to provide dynamic or environment-specific configuration information.

---

## Context of Use

- **Modular Code Design:**  
  This approach allows maintaining clean source files, as build or environment configurations can be managed independently.

- **Automation Friendly:**  
  Automatically generated configuration files enable easier adaptation across different build targets, environments, or release processes.

---

## No Direct Logic

- The file contains **no executable logic or functions**, and its behavior entirely depends on the contents of the included file.
