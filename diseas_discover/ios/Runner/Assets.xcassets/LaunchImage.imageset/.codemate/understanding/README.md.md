High-Level Documentation:

This directory stores the image assets used for the application's launch (splash) screen on iOS.

Key Points:

- You can customize your Flutter app's launch screen appearance by replacing the default image files in this directory with your own images.
- Alternatively, you can use Xcode to manage launch screen images:
  1. Open your Flutter app's iOS project with Xcode using: open ios/Runner.xcworkspace.
  2. In Xcode's Project Navigator, select Runner/Assets.xcassets.
  3. Drag and drop your desired image(s) into the appropriate asset catalog.
- These assets determine what appears to users while the app is launching, before the main interface is displayed. 
- Proper configuration here ensures a branded, polished startup experience for iOS users.
