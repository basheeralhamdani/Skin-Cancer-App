# High-Level Documentation

## Overview

This code is a JSON file that defines the **App Icon set** for an iOS application. It is typically named `Contents.json` and is found within an Xcode project's icon asset catalog (e.g., `AppIcon.appiconset`). The file specifies the various sizes and resolutions of app icons required for different Apple devices and contexts.

## Structure

- **images**:  
  An array where each object details a specific app icon.
  - **size**: Required icon dimension (e.g., "20x20", "60x60", "1024x1024") in points.
  - **idiom**: The device or context the icon is for, such as `iphone`, `ipad`, or `ios-marketing` (App Store).
  - **filename**: The name of the icon image file to use for this configuration.
  - **scale**: The resolution multiplier (`1x`, `2x`, or `3x`).

- **info**:  
  Metadata about the JSON file itself.
  - **version**: The format version of the file (usually 1).
  - **author**: Indicates the tool that created or maintains the file (usually "xcode").

## Purpose

This file **instructs Xcode** and the build process which icon images to use for different screen sizes, resolutions, and devices, ensuring correct icon appearance across all supported platforms and contexts (home screen, settings, App Store, notifications, etc.).

## Usage

- Developers place this file and its referenced PNG images within the project's asset catalog.
- Xcode uses this manifest to package the correct icons for each target during build and app store submission.

## Key Points

- Ensures compliance with Apple's icon requirements.
- Each image is listed with appropriate size, scale, idiom, and filename.
- Includes icons for iPhone, iPad, and App Store (marketing).
