### Structure

1. **Header (`IHDR` chunk):**
   - Specifies basic image metadata such as width, height, color depth, and color type.

2. **Image Data (`IDAT` chunk):**
   - Encodes the actual pixel data, typically using lossless compression (zlib/deflate).

3. **End of Image (`IEND` chunk):**
   - Marks the end of the PNG file.

### Usage

- This file can be used as a PNG image and visualized with any software capable of displaying standard PNG graphics.

### Remarks

- No executable code or algorithms are present.
- The contents are intended to be interpreted by image viewers or applications supporting PNG format.
