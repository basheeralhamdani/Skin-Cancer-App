# High-Level Documentation

This code imports a header file named `GeneratedPluginRegistrant.h`. 

**Purpose:**  
It is typically used in Flutter (iOS) projects generated with Objective-C, enabling the automatic registration of plugins with the application. This file is auto-generated and manages the integration of various third-party plugins, ensuring that all native functionalities required by Dart/Flutter code are accessible from the iOS platform side. 

**Usage:**  
Developers include this import at the start of main application files (such as `AppDelegate.m`) so that the plugin registration occurs during app initialization. No direct modification of this file is necessary; Flutter tooling handles its content.

**Summary:**  
- Ensures all Flutter plugins are registered and available when the app runs.
- Common in cross-platform (Flutter) app projects targeting iOS.
