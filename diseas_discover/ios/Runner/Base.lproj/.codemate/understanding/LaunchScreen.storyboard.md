# High-Level Documentation

## Overview

This XML file defines an iOS Storyboard/XIB, specifically for a **Launch Screen** in an iOS application. It describes the visual interface and object relationships for a single view controller. The storyboard makes use of Auto Layout for responsive UI.

---

## Main Features

### 1. **View Controller Scene**
- **Single Scene:** There is one scene containing a single `UIViewController`, which is the initial view controller (marked as `initialViewController`).
- **Layout Guides:** Built-in top and bottom layout guides to assist with layout constraints.

### 2. **View Hierarchy**
- **Root View:** The scene's top-level view (`UIView`) has a white background.
- **Image View:**
  - **Subview:** An `UIImageView` is added as a subview.
  - **Image:** Displays an image resource named `"LaunchImage"`.
  - **Content Mode:** Set to "Center".
  - **Clipping & Touch:** Clips subviews, supports multiple touch.

### 3. **Auto Layout Constraints**
- The `UIImageView` is **centered** both vertically and horizontally within the root view via constraints.

### 4. **Resources**
- The storyboard references a single image resource: `LaunchImage`, with specified dimensions.

## Purpose

This storyboard is designed to serve as a minimalist launch screen for an iOS app, showing a centered image (`LaunchImage`) on a white background during app startup, before loading the main interface.

## Customization

To change the appearance of the launch screen, modify the image resource, background color, or adjust layout and constraints as needed within this file.
