Title: Storyboard Configuration for a Flutter-Based iOS View Controller

Overview:
This XML code represents a storyboard file used in iOS development with Xcode's Interface Builder. The storyboard is specifically configured for integrating a Flutter view within a native iOS application.

Key Components:

1. Document Declaration
   - Indicates this is an Interface Builder document (XIB/Storyboard).
   - Targets the iOS runtime with support for Auto Layout and Size Classes.

2. Dependencies
   - Specifies compatibility with iOS deployment.
   - Utilizes the CocoaTouch plugin for UIKit-based interfaces.

3. Scene Definition
   - Contains a single scene which is the main window when the app launches.

4. View Controller
   - Custom class: FlutterViewController, used for embedding a Flutter UI in iOS.
   - Set as the initial view controller for the app.
   - Lays out interface guides for top and bottom margins.

5. Root View
   - The main view fills its parent and is set with a white background.
   - Uses Auto Layout and an autoresizing mask to adapt to screen sizes.

6. Placeholder
   - Includes a placeholder for the First Responder for interaction management.

Usage Context:
This storyboard is typically used in hybrid iOS applications where a Flutter module is presented within a native iOS app. The FlutterViewController ensures seamless presentation of Flutter content inside UIKit view hierarchies.

Summary:
The storyboard defines the initial view controller as a FlutterViewController with a basic white view, intended to integrate Flutter’s UI into the app’s native interface as the launch/primary screen. All configuration elements are standard for embedding Flutter content in iOS apps using storyboards.
