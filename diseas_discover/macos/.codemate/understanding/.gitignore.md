High-Level Documentation

This file is a gitignore configuration, specifying files and directories that should be ignored by version control systems (like Git) during development. Its goal is to prevent the inclusion of build artifacts, auto-generated content, and local developer-specific settings in the repository. Specifically, it covers:

1. Flutter-related:
   - Ignores all files in `/Flutter/ephemeral/` and all `/Pods/` directories, which contain temporary build files and dependency packages handled by Flutter and CocoaPods.

2. Xcode-related:
   - Ignores all `dgph` directories, as well as `xcuserdata/`, both specific to Xcode's project and user settings, to avoid committing environment-specific data and cache to source control.

By using this configuration, the repository remains clean and portable, containing only essential source files and configuration needed for collaboration and deployment.
