# High-Level Documentation

## Overview
This code defines a basic unit test class for a macOS Flutter application using the Cocoa and XCTest frameworks. The test class is called `RunnerTests`.

## Key Components

- **Imports**:
  - `Cocoa`: Provides access to fundamental macOS application classes.
  - `FlutterMacOS`: Imports Flutter-specific support for macOS.
  - `XCTest`: Framework for writing unit tests in Swift/Objective-C.

- **RunnerTests Class**:
  - Subclass of `XCTestCase`, which is the base class for defining test cases in XCTest.
  - Contains a placeholder method `testExample` for adding future test logic.

## Usage

- The `RunnerTests` class can be extended by adding test methods to validate the behavior of the Flutter macOS app.
- The provided `testExample` method is a template for developers to add their own test logic.
- Official XCTest documentation is referenced for further information on writing tests.

## Context

- This is intended as a starting point (boilerplate) for adding automated tests to a Flutter macOS app host ("Runner").
- No actual test assertions or application-specific checks are implemented yet.
