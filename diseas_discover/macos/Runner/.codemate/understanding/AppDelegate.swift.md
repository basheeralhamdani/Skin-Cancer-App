# High-Level Documentation

## Overview
This Swift code defines the main application delegate for a macOS Flutter application. It customizes some behaviors of the application lifecycle by subclassing FlutterAppDelegate. The delegate is responsible for handling application-level events such as window closing and state restoration.

## Key Functionalities

1. **Application Entry Point**
   - The `@main` annotation designates `AppDelegate` as the entry point of the application.

2. **Inheritance**
   - `AppDelegate` inherits from `FlutterAppDelegate`, integrating Flutter with the macOS app lifecycle.

3. **Lifecycle Customizations**
   - **Terminate After Last Window Closed:**
     - When the user closes the last window, the application will terminate automatically (`applicationShouldTerminateAfterLastWindowClosed` returns `true`).
   - **Secure State Restoration:**
     - The app declares support for secure state restoration (`applicationSupportsSecureRestorableState` returns `true`), enabling the system to safely restore the appâ€™s state if needed.

## Import Dependencies
- `Cocoa`: Provides macOS essentials (windowing, event handling, etc.).
- `FlutterMacOS`: Integrates Flutter engine with the macOS app.

**Summary:**  
This code sets up the main delegate for a macOS Flutter application, ensuring it quits when the last window closes and securely restores its state as needed.
