# High-Level Documentation

## Overview

This file is an **Info.plist** (Property List) for a macOS application. It is an XML file used by the macOS system to read key metadata and configuration details about the app. It specifies various properties such as the app's name, version, identifier, main executable, and main interface settings.

## Key Functional Areas

- **Localization and Executable**:
  - Sets the development language used by the app.
  - Defines the main executable binary name.

- **App Identification**:
  - Sets the application bundle identifier (a unique string for app identification).
  - Specifies the app's display name and version details (short version and build number).
  - Indicates the app's copyright.

- **Packaging and System Requirements**:
  - States the package type (`APPL` for standard apps).
  - Sets the minimum supported macOS version.

- **User Interface**:
  - Defines the main NIB file for the UI (`MainMenu`).
  - Sets the principal class that acts as the app's entry point (`NSApplication`).

- **Icon**:
  - Placeholder for the app icon file.

- **Build Variable Expansion**:
  - Uses build environment variables (`$(VARIABLE_NAME)`) so values can be dynamically inserted during the build process (e.g., version, identifier, copyright).

## Usage Context

This **Info.plist** is essential for any macOS application, including those built using frameworks like Flutter or natively with Xcode. It provides all the baseline configuration required for the app to launch and be managed by the macOS system.
