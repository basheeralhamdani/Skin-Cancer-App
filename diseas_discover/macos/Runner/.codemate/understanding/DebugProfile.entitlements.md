# High-Level Documentation

## Overview

This file is a **macOS App Sandbox Entitlements Property List (plist)**. It defines security capabilities for a macOS application, controlling the privileges it is granted when running within the sandboxed environment.

## Key Permissions Defined

1. **App Sandbox Enabled**
   - **Key:** `com.apple.security.app-sandbox`
   - **Value:** `true`
   - **Description:** The application runs inside the macOS sandbox, isolating it from system resources and other apps for increased security.

2. **JIT Compilation Allowed**
   - **Key:** `com.apple.security.cs.allow-jit`
   - **Value:** `true`
   - **Description:** Allows the app to use Just-In-Time (JIT) code generation, necessary for certain runtime execution environments (e.g., browsers, virtual machines).

3. **Network Server Capability**
   - **Key:** `com.apple.security.network.server`
   - **Value:** `true`
   - **Description:** Grants the app permission to open network sockets for listening (i.e., act as a network server).

## Purpose

The entitlements file configures a macOS application to:
- Run securely within the sandbox.
- Dynamically generate and execute code via JIT.
- Listen for and accept incoming network connections.

This setup is typically required for apps that need advanced code execution (like web browsers or developer tools) and networking capabilities beyond simple client connections, while still maintaining overall app security.
