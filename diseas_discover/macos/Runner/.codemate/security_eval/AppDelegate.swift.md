# Security Vulnerability Report

**Source:** macOS Flutter App Delegate

---

## 1. Analysis Scope

This report reviews the following Swift code for security vulnerabilities:

```swift
import Cocoa
import FlutterMacOS

@main
class AppDelegate: FlutterAppDelegate {
  override func applicationShouldTerminateAfterLastWindowClosed(_ sender: NSApplication) -> Bool {
    return true
  }

  override func applicationSupportsSecureRestorableState(_ app: NSApplication) -> Bool {
    return true
  }
}
```

---

## 2. Security Vulnerability Findings

### 2.1. Absence of Obvious Direct Vulnerabilities

- **No Sensitive Data Handling:**  
  The provided code sample does not handle user input, secrets, URLs, file access, network requests, or other sensitive data flows.

- **No APIs for Permissions or Security Policies:**  
  There are no explicit permissions or security-affecting API calls in this code.

### 2.2. Methods Reviewed

- **applicationShouldTerminateAfterLastWindowClosed**  
  - Behavior: Terminates the application when the last window closes.
  - Security Impact: None.

- **applicationSupportsSecureRestorableState**  
  - Returns true, which **enables secure restorable state support** in macOS (macOS 13+). This can be considered a security improvement, as it helps prevent unauthorized state restoration attacks.

### 2.3. Potential Indirect Risk

- **No Explicit Security Controls Found**  
  This code does not introduce nor mitigate any vulnerabilities by itself.

- **Dependency on Parent Classes**  
  If `FlutterAppDelegate` is extended insecurely elsewhere, vulnerabilities could exist outside this snippet, but not within the code shown.

## 3. Security Best Practice Recommendations

| Recommendation | Status | Rationale |
|----------------|--------|-----------|
| Use Secure State Restoration | âœ“      | `applicationSupportsSecureRestorableState` is set to true. |
| Principle of Least Privilege | N/A    | No privilege changes occur in this code. |
| Handle Sensitive Data Carefully | N/A   | No sensitive data access in this code. |

---

## 4. Summary

**NO security vulnerabilities found in this code snippet.**

- Code **does not perform or permit any actions** that could introduce security issues given the context provided.
- If vulnerabilities exist, they would arise elsewhere (e.g., Flutter plugins, app logic, file/network code).

---

**If this code will be modified in the future to launch subprocesses, access files, or handle user input/data, a fresh security review is advised.**
