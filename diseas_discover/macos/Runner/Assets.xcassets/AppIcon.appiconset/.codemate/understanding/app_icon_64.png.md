**High-Level Documentation:**

This code represents a PNG image file.

- **File Type:** PNG format (indicated by the initial PNG signature).
- **Structure:** Composed of typical binary chunks such as IHDR (image header), sRGB (standard RGB color space), IDAT (image data), and IEND (end of file).
- **Purpose:** Encodes and compresses raster graphicsâ€”this file likely contains a small, possibly icon-sized image (based on the width and height fields).
- **Content:** The actual pixel data and ancillary data (such as color space info) are stored in the binary data sections.
- **Usage:** This image file can be read or displayed using any standard PNG-compatible viewer or processor.

**Note:**  
No executable code or logic is present; this is purely a binary image asset encapsulated as a PNG.
