# High-Level Documentation

## Purpose
This code defines application-level settings for the "Runner" target in a Flutter desktop/macOS project.

## Overview
- The file specifies key metadata about the application, such as the name, bundle identifier, and copyright.
- These settings are typically used by the build system (e.g., Xcode) to configure the app's properties.
- In the future, these values may be auto-generated from the project's metadata (e.g., `pubspec.yaml`).

## Key Settings

- **PRODUCT_NAME**: Sets the application’s display name and window title (`diseas_discover`).
- **PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER**: Specifies the app’s unique bundle identifier, used for identification and distribution (`com.example.diseasDiscover`).
- **PRODUCT_COPYRIGHT**: Provides copyright information displayed in the app’s information (`Copyright © 2025 com.example. All rights reserved.`).

## Usage
These variables are used during the build process to set application properties for deployment and display. Changing these values customizes the identity and basic legal information of the generated application.
