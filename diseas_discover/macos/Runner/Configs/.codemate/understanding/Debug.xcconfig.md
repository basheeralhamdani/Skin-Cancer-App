**High-Level Documentation**

This configuration file is part of an Xcode project and is written in the Xcode configuration (xcconfig) format, which is used to manage build settings.

- **Purpose:**  
  - To include and centralize build configuration settings for different build environments and components, particularly for a Flutter-based project.

- **Included Files:**
  1. `../../Flutter/Flutter-Debug.xcconfig`  
     - Imports common Flutter debug build settings, likely containing Flutter-specific build flags and paths for a debug environment.
  2. `Warnings.xcconfig`  
     - Includes custom warning and compiler flag configurations, likely for managing how warnings are handled during the build process.

- **Usage:**  
  - This file is intended to be included in an Xcode target's build configuration settings for consistency and reusability.
  - It helps maintain modular and maintainable build settings by separating Flutter integration and compiler warnings logic.

- **Modifiability:**  
  - By editing the included files, developers can update build behaviors for all projects importing this configuration without directly modifying each individual config.

- **Notes:**  
  - The order of includes matters; settings in later included files can override those in earlier ones.
  - There are no direct build or compiler settings within this fileâ€”it acts solely as a bridge to other configuration files.
