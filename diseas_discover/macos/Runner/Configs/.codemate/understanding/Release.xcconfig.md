# High-Level Documentation

This configuration file is used in an Xcode project to include build settings from other configuration files.

## Overview

- **Purpose:**  
  This file aggregates and applies build configuration settings from two separate files to manage the build environment for an iOS/macOS application (likely a Flutter-integrated project).

## Includes

1. **`../../Flutter/Flutter-Release.xcconfig`**
   - **Role:**  
     Incorporates predefined build settings required for building a Flutter app in release mode.
   - **Likely Content:**  
     Paths, optimization flags, and Flutter framework-specific settings.

2. **`Warnings.xcconfig`**
   - **Role:**  
     Adds or overrides warning-related build settings.
   - **Likely Content:**  
     Warning level adjustments, enable/disable of certain compiler warnings, and settings to treat warnings as errors.

## Usage

- This file does not define any settings by itself but acts as a consolidation layer, pulling in configuration from the specified files.
- It should be referenced in the project's build configuration (e.g., as a Release.xcconfig file in Xcode).

---

**Summary:**  
This code combines essential build configuration settings for a Flutter-based Xcode project by including both Flutter release and custom warning configuration files.
