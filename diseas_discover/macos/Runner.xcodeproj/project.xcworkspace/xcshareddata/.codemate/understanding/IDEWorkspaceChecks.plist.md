High-Level Documentation

Purpose:
This file is a macOS Property List (plist) document, typically used by Xcode and other Apple development tools for storing configuration settings.

Functionality:
- The plist defines a single key-value pair.
- The key IDEDidComputeMac32BitWarning, when set to true, indicates that a warning about 32-bit macOS application compatibility has been computed or acknowledged by the development environment (often Xcode).

Usage Context:
- It is commonly found within Xcode project or workspace directories.
- It signals to Xcode that it has already displayed a warning to the user regarding 32-bit macOS support, preventing repeat warnings.

Summary:
This plist serves as a flag for Xcode to remember whether the Mac 32-bit compatibility warning has been shown, improving user experience by avoiding redundant alerts.
