## High-Level Documentation: Xcode Project Configuration (Runner.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj)

This file is the Xcode project configuration for a **Flutter macOS application** named `Runner` (target binary: `diseas_discover.app`). It defines the structure, build settings, and build phases for the native macOS portion of the Flutter project.

---

### 1. **Project Structure**

- **Targets**
  - **Runner**: The main macOS application target.
  - **RunnerTests**: Unit test target for the Runner app.
  - **Flutter Assemble**: Aggregate target that runs Flutter's build process before building the native app.

- **Groups/Folders**
  - **Runner**: Contains main application Swift sources, assets, entitlements, and configurations.
  - **RunnerTests**: Contains Swift test files.
  - **Frameworks**: Placeholder for external frameworks.
  - **Products**: Built app and test products.
  - **Flutter**: Auto-generated Flutter integration Swift and build configs.
  - **Configs**: Shared xcconfig files for build customization.

---

### 2. **Build Configurations**

- Each target has three build configurations: **Debug**, **Release**, and **Profile**.
  - Build settings reference `.xcconfig` files for custom build parameters.
  - The main app builds with code signing, asset management, and Swift versioning settings.
  - Test target links to the built app for host target integration.

---

### 3. **Build Phases**

#### **Runner Target**
- **Sources**: Compiles Swift source code.
- **Frameworks**: Links necessary frameworks.
- **Resources**: Bundles assets and UI files.
- **Bundle Framework**: Prepares frameworks for app bundle.
- **ShellScript**: Runs the **Flutter embed script**, which triggers Flutter's build system to assemble and embed the Flutter framework and assets into the macOS app.

#### **Flutter Assemble Target**
- **ShellScript**: Runs the **macos_assemble.sh** script (from Flutter SDK) to build Flutter code and outputs a marker file (`tripwire`) with file lists for incremental builds.

#### **RunnerTests Target**
- **Sources**: Compiles unit test source files.
- **Frameworks & Resources**: For linking and resource access as needed.

---

### 4. **Code Signing & Provisioning**

- **Runner**: Uses *automatic* code signing for easier provisioning, with different entitlements for Debug/Profile vs Release.
- **Flutter Assemble**: Uses *manual* code signing, as it doesn't produce a standalone product.
- **Test Target**: Inherits app's bundle information for proper test execution.

---

### 5. **Flutter & Auto Generation**

- **GeneratedPluginRegistrant.swift**: Integrates Flutter plugins into the native runner.
- **Flutter Build Phases**: Ensures Flutter's Dart code and assets are always built and embedded prior to building the native project, using the `macos_assemble.sh` script and ephemeral marker files for efficiency and dependency tracking.

---

### 6. **Configuration Files**

- **xcconfig Files**: Provide centralized build settings for different schemes (Debug, Release, Profile, Warnings, AppInfo, Flutter configs).
- **Entitlements**: Separate plist files define sandboxing and permissions for different build types.

---

### 7. **Summary**

This project is set up for a standard **Flutter macOS application** with:
- Proper Xcode integration for native and Flutter code.
- Automated build steps to ensure the Flutter engine/code is assembled and included.
- Support for unit testing.
- Configurable and maintainable build setups via external configs and entitlements.
- Modern Swift and macOS standards (deployment target 10.14+).

---

**Typical Workflow**:  
1. Xcode invokes `Flutter Assemble` (which runs `macos_assemble.sh`).  
2. Flutter builds Dart code, assets, and frameworks, then marks the build as complete.  
3. Xcode builds the native app, linking all Flutter assets and platform Swift code.  
4. Optionally, Xcode can build and run the included unit tests.

This configuration is auto-managed by **Flutter tooling**; direct modifications are uncommon unless advanced/native customizations are required for the macOS platform.
