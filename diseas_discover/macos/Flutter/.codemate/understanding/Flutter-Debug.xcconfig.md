# High-Level Documentation

This code consists of a single line:

```cpp
#include "ephemeral/Flutter-Generated.xcconfig"
```

## Purpose

- **Include Build Configuration:**  
  This line includes a configuration file, typically auto-generated by the Flutter toolchain, into the current build or project. The file extension `.xcconfig` denotes an Xcode configuration file, which is commonly used in iOS/macOS development to define build settings.

## Context

- **Flutter Projects:**  
  This inclusion is found in projects that use Flutter to build iOS/macOS applications. The `Flutter-Generated.xcconfig` file contains important build parameters (like the Flutter framework path, build modes, etc.) required for integrating Flutter with Xcode.

- **Ephemeral Directory:**  
  The `ephemeral` directory is usually a temporary folder generated during Flutter builds. Its contents can be regenerated and are not meant to be edited manually.

## Summary of Functionality

- **Purpose:** Establish the necessary build environment and settings for compiling a Flutter-backed iOS/macOS project in Xcode.
- **Impact:** Ensures the build uses correct linker flags, search paths, and other dynamic configuration details generated by Flutter.

## Usage Note

- **Do Not Edit:** Developers should not modify the included `.xcconfig` file directly, as it is auto-generated and subject to be overwritten by Flutter's build system.
- **Flutter Dependency:** The project’s build relies on Flutter’s build process to generate the necessary configuration in the `ephemeral` folder.

---

**In short:**  
This code integrates the Flutter auto-generated build configuration settings into the current project to enable proper iOS/macOS builds when using Flutter.
