High-Level Documentation

Overview:
This XML configuration defines an Xcode workspace. An Xcode workspace is a container that enables you to organize multiple projects and resources for iOS/macOS application development within Apple's Xcode IDE.

Key Components:

- Version: The workspace file specifies its configuration version as 1.0.

- FileRef: The workspace references one project file named "Runner.xcodeproj", which is likely the primary Xcode project for the application. The "group:" prefix in the location attribute indicates that the file is referenced relative to the workspace.

Purpose:
This workspace setup enables developers to open and manage the "Runner.xcodeproj" project (and potentially others) together within Xcode. It is often used in projects that require integration of multiple targets or dependencies, streamlining the development workflow.

Common Use Case:
In contexts such as Flutter app development for iOS, the workspace file (commonly named "Runner.xcworkspace") is auto-generated to manage the main project and any integrations like CocoaPods plugins. Opening the workspace (rather than just the .xcodeproj) ensures all dependencies and build configurations work correctly together.
